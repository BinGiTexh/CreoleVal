“Ndara ti Salomon”	7 Regarding the Lord’s Evening Meal, Paul said: “As often as you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives.” (1 Corinthians 11:26) Individual anointed Christians would partake of the Memorial emblems until their death.	376	That temple is Jehovah’s arrangement for approaching him in worship on the basis of the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ Jesus.	213
Beku wa la mo yeke na ni na ndö ti zingongo ti akuâ?	In such a case, you are not caving in to pressure but simply following the Bible’s advice: “Let your reasonableness become known.”​—Philippians 4:5.	824	Becoming an Intimate Companion of God	798
Afä ti ndoye so ayeke sala kusala adö mingi bê ti azo so amä na bê pepe, a sala si ambeni atene na ndo aChrétien: ‘Ba tongana nyen ala ndoye tele na popo ti ala.’	James 2:15, 16 states: “If a brother or a sister is in a naked state and lacking the food sufficient for the day, yet a certain one of you says to them: ‘Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,’ but you do not give them the necessities for their body, of what benefit is it?”	817	“Accordingly he entered into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table.	426

Rather, for about six years, he humbly accompanied the older prophet and assisted him, later being known as the one “who used to pour out water on the hands of Elijah.” (2 Kings 3:11) How comforting for Elijah to have such a capable, helpful attendant!	816	In contrast, Jesus spoke of only two choices.	335

(aProverbe 8:22-31; aColossien 1:15-17).	13 Our prayers to God reveal our motives, interests, and desires. Jehovah knows what we are inside. Says Proverbs 17:3: “The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, but Jehovah is the examiner of hearts.” God sees what is in our heart.	163	That is why we need a ransom.​—Read Romans 5:12; 6:23.	173

Awango ti Jéhovah ayeke ye so zo alingbi ti zia bê ti lo dä, 15/9	14 How, then, can we acquire the ability to distinguish between right and wrong?	802	When Moses asked to see His glory, Jehovah responded: “You are not able to see my face, because no man may see me and yet live.”	978
Me ye nyen ayeke si tongana watokua ni ake biaku ti sala tënë ti tokua ni?	So Elijah modestly replied: “You have asked a difficult thing.	11	Or what of the prophecy of the wolf with the lamb and the kid with the leopard?	937

Ngbanga ti nyen a yeke nzoni e sara ye so ngbâa be-ta-zo so ayeke sara ye na ndara afa?	Some find it easier to comment when they sit toward the front of the Kingdom Hall.	337	As did the Hebrew Christians, we can read of and cooperate with that purpose.	524
Na ngoi ti bira so, azo ti Nzapa atene so ti gue oko na prophétie ti Apocalypse, image ti nyama ti ngonda ni ayeke kiri ti bâ gigi.	I could continue to help those who had not had a chance to learn about Jehovah!”	273	At times, we may feel overwhelmed and inadequate in the face of a new assignment, or we may be losing some of our courage to continue with our Kingdom-preaching work as we face increasing indifference or opposition in our territory.	186
