Their overlays of gold and silver pale into dead meaninglessness in comparison to the magnificence of the eternal God, Jehovah, and the glories of his living creations.	417	We can understand who our Creator is and admire and imitate his love and justice.​—Read Ecclesiastes 12:13; Micah 6:8.	455
6 Na yâ angu 1930, na yâ angoi so ayeke gue ti si na Use Bira so Amu Sese Kue, ayanga-ti-komande ti ngangu akanga lege wala azia katikati na kusala ti aTémoin ti Jéhovah na Zamani, Espagne, na Japon, ti fa gi a-iri ota so.	(Proverbs 27:3) To fight off feelings of discouragement and tiredness, we do well to avoid the company of those who dwell on negative thoughts and are prone to find fault and criticize others.	237	Opposers must know that.	60
Ti gbu nda ti tënë so zo amä yâ ni pëpe so nzoni ayeke pusu e ti fa nzoni tënë ti Royaume ti Nzapa na bê ti e kue nga ti fa tënë ti lango ti fango ngbanga ti Jéhovah.	17 We need to realize that the Devil, the one who first disrupted universal peace, will strongly oppose our efforts to do God’s will.	15	6 Who will remain in place of wicked people?	87
Mbeti ti Nzapa so a sû na yanga ti Hébreu afa mbeni tënë ti prophétie na ndo Jésus Christ, atene: “Fade Lo sö zo so ye amanke lo mingi tongana lo toto na Lo, na Lo sö zo ti vundu so ayeke na zo oko pëpe ti sara na lo.	6 Who will remain in place of wicked people?	86	(Matthew 7:13, 14; 1 Peter 2:9) Like that traveling merchant, they had given up much to follow Jesus in pursuit of the Kingdom.	114
Ngbanga ti so tongana e gi bê senge senge na ndo ti aye so e bezoin ni lâ na lâ, a yeke sara pëpe si e ngbâ na fini aninga.	If that ever happens to you, turn to Jehovah and his people for help so as not to allow yourself to be deprived of the prize.​—Read Psalm 34:18; Proverbs 13:20.	511	(Psalm 121:2) Why was this psalmist convinced that Jehovah would help him?	332
Bazengele Paul so ayeke mbeni zo so aga na lege ti kozo koli so atene: “Mbi yeke ti mitele, a kä mbi na siokpari.”​—aRomain 7:14.	Nonetheless, are we not thankful that Jehovah uses his spirit to qualify and equip us as teachers of his Word?	830	Just as he lays the foundation, someone comes along and destroys what has been laid.	174
16 Jésus azia mbeni tapande so ayeke nzoni ahon atanga ni kue na lege so ndoye ti lo na mbage ti Jéhovah apusu lo ti mä yanga ti lo na bê kue (Jean 8:28, 29).	“Practice giving, and people will give to you,” said Jesus. “They will pour into your laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together and overflowing.	241	Sadly, Israel ignored that divine message and failed to take the right action.	685
Mingi ti atableau so angbâ juska laso, ye so afa polele so a yeke ngbele ye giriri si azo ato nda ti sû agere-mbeti.	(Titus 1:16) The apostle Peter likewise warned that false teachers would “quietly bring in destructive sects and [would] disown even the owner that bought them.”	422	And the apostle Peter wrote: “You [anointed Christians] know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were delivered from your fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from your forefathers. But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.”​—1 Peter 1:18, 19.	943
Peut-être lo sara tongaso ndali ti so lo ye ti tomba mbi na kua ape.	Children thrive on loving attention and commendation	479	(Matt. 9:36; Mark 6:34) We have every reason to be zealous for true worship, as Jesus was.	872
Ën.	“But one day, you say to yourself, ‘It’s my religion because these are my convictions.’” Like many other young Witnesses of Jehovah, Amélie knows that her solid religious convictions give her a purpose in life and are a source of lasting happiness.	692	Material possessions do not deliver; they are unrealities.	21
Jéhovah na azo ti lo asara ye tongana nyen na ndo ti tënë ti mbele so ayeke na popo ti ala?	They give of their time, energy, and resources to promote pure worship.	244	As a result, I felt loved and was not jealous of the time he spent serving the congregation.”	238
Jéhovah ayeke iri deba nzoni pëpe na ndo ti azo ti kengo yanga nga lo yeke sara ni pëpe na azo ti kpengba-li.​—Nombre 12:1, 2, 9-11.	Why might some hesitate to study the Bible, and how may you help them to overcome their reluctance?	688	Her role is reflected in the way she communicates.	539
A yeke ngbâ lakue ti mû maboko na aChrétien ti gi nda ti aye ti Nzapa so ndani alï mingi?	(Col. 1:6, 23) To illustrate: Because of what the apostle Paul said and did on the island of Cyprus, the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus “became a believer, for he was astounded at the teaching of Jehovah.”​—Read Acts 13:6-12.	398	How can the book of Leviticus help us?	363
A si na lango omene ni lo mû yanga na aturugu ti lo ti ngoro aJuif ni so, na ti tene na ala so tongana ala zia lege ti ngonzo ni pëpe, a yeke fâ ala.	The pain was excruciating, but despite the pain I went to work the next day.	460	(John 5:28, 29) What does that prospect do for the surviving mate?	548
Na tongo nda ti lettre ti Paul na aHébreu, lo gboto mê ti ala na ndo ti kpale so.	Moreover, the murmurers did not act as troublemakers and raise their voices against Jehovah.	200	Their sincere concern for his welfare​—their self-sacrificing love—​moved them to act swiftly in his behalf, opening the way for the jailer and his entire household to become believers.	151
HINGA SO JÉHOVAH AYEKE MÄ KA ASAMBELA	Why is hard work needed to gain an accurate knowledge of God?	73	(Rev. 7:9, 10) Many young people are enjoying thrilling experiences as they help others to understand lifesaving Bible truths.	751
[Foto na lembeti 7]	Drinking wine was obviously acceptable to Jesus.	545	With great joy and zeal, then, we obey the divine command to let light shine out of darkness to Jehovah’s glory.	958
Tongaso, zo ti mosoro so airi wabatango ye ni na lo tene na lo: ‘Tënë ti nyen si mbi yeke mä na ndo ti mo so?	He also mentioned that he had changed his itinerary, informing them that he would first go to Macedonia and then to Corinth.​—1 Cor. 16:5, 6.*	215	Before long, he and two of his companions were expelled from the army, and they dedicated their lives to Jehovah God.	103
Lo yeke zia apériodique ti e ngbangbo mingi nze oko oko.	They trusted in Jehovah. Were they blessed? Absolutely!	506	(Col. 1:15) Even before coming to earth, Jesus chose to remain loyal to his Father and not join Satan in his rebellion.	556
Tongana amolenge azia da ahon	Before long, he and two of his companions were expelled from the army, and they dedicated their lives to Jehovah God.	101	(Phil. 1:7) Those city magistrates would think twice before doing anything against the newly formed Christian congregation in their city.	601
[Ahundango Tene ti Manda na Ye]	(Prov. 1:8, 9) After all, they want you to gain life, something far more valuable than wealth or prestige in this world.​—Matt. 16:26.	630	How does the holy spirit assist us in our preaching?	820
Tongana ti so mbeti-sango The Irish Times atene, “londongo ti gbâ ti atënë nde nde na ndo atënë ti mabe, so atene mbeni lege ti vorongo so ayeke nzoni ahon amba ti lo ayeke dä pëpe, agbu lani mingi bê ti kota-bua Ratzinger.”	Now, I feel that I can approach Jehovah without anything being in the way.”	322	“We have been taught to hate the Turks for years,” Greek columnist Anna Stergiou wrote in an Athens newspaper.	658
Lo tene so Jéhovah Nzapa ayeke bi bê ti lo mingi na ndo amaseka, na lo yeke mû maboko na ala kue so ague na mbage ti lo ti wara dengo bê.	In fact, “statistics show that [in Europe] half of those who get married will divorce,” reports the Institute for Family Policy in Spain.	586	16 Humility and modesty help a married person focus on the strengths of his or her mate.	522
Azo ti kiringo na peko ti ambeti so ayeke gi mbeni kete mbage ti gbâ ti azo 2 300 so amû tere ti ala wani ti sara kua so na ando 190 tongaso na ndo ti sese kue.	(Eph. 5:33; Gen. 2:23, 24) Over time, the attachment a couple have to each other gains strength, as does their love for each other.	898	Jehovah condemned Israelites who divorced their wives on frivolous grounds and married pagan women	596
(Luc 10:2-4). Ngbanga ti nyen la Jésus atene na ala tongaso?	(2) Paul also wrote that each person should give “in keeping with his income.” (1 Corinthians 16:2b, New International Version) In other words, an individual who wants to share in voluntary giving can do so proportionately.	665	In line with that, one reference work defines “sacrifice” as “a religious rite in which an object is offered to a divinity in order to establish, maintain, or restore a right relationship of man to the sacred order.”	591
Bâ ambeni tapande ni:	LUKE 21:11; REVELATION 6:8	587	4 Ecclesiastes 12:1 states: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.”	216
Jésus atene lani na adisciple ti lo ti ku tere ti ala na mara ti ye tongaso (Mat. 5:11, 12).	So imagine my joy and surprise when, in January 1946, I received an invitation to go to Bethel in London to help with the work there for three weeks.	427	Stephen had a fine reputation among the brothers and was therefore chosen to be one of seven certified men who would handle this daily distribution of food.	808
Na salango tënë ti ngangu so yingo ni ayeke sala na ndo azo, bazengele Paul asû mbeti na aChrétien ti Ephèse ti giriri, lo tene: “I tambela . . . giriri na lege ti sese so, na lege ti mokonzi ti angangu ti nduzu, yingo so ayeke sala na yâ amolenge ti azo so ake tënë.	With the assistance of a younger elder, José was able to continue serving joyfully as presiding overseer, and this has been a blessing to the congregation.	895	Praise the name of Jehovah, offer praise, O servants of Jehovah, you who are standing in the house of Jehovah, in the courtyards of the house of our God.	306
Hio e zia ti gue na Église Orthodoxe. E gue e bungbi oko na kete groupe ti aTémoin so ayeke na Sitía, si e fa nga na angambe ti e fini mabe so e wara.	4 Another woman who received her dead by resurrection lived in the town of Shunem.	3	Let us, then, examine some of the facets of Jehovah’s matchless love.	122

Kusala so a mû na e ayeke ti ngbâ ti fa tënë na azo kue na ti “zia pëpe” ti sara ni.​—Diko Kusala 5:42.	(Matthew 7:13, 14; 1 Peter 2:9) Like that traveling merchant, they had given up much to follow Jesus in pursuit of the Kingdom.	87	For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.”—Philippians 4:11-13.	492
Me a tene nga so e ‘lingbi hinga pëpe nda ti kusala so Nzapa asara, a komanse na lâ ti kozoni juska na lâ ti nda ni.’	18 As noted, a mature Christian can be a powerful influence for good in the congregation.	145	So after much prayer, I decided that I should stay to help care for Joan.	526
16 Aye so asi na Élie alingbi ti mû maboko na e ti gi ti bâ wala e yeke na yâ ti mabe nga a lingbi ti pusu e ti duti na nzoni bango ndo.	Jacob sought to make peace with Esau, but not because Jacob had erred against his brother and owed him an apology.	424	Such seeing is based on accurate knowledge and is perceived spiritually with ‘the eyes of the heart.’ (Ephesians 1:18) The words and deeds of Jesus also reveal much about God.	592
(Zo-ti-fa-tene 3:1, 7).	Justin Martyr believed that hell was a fiery place	341	Like the ancient prophet Jeremiah, Peter and John could not hold back from carrying out their commission to preach.​—Acts 4:18-20; Jeremiah 20:9.	32
So aye ti tene so na yâ ndoye ti lo, Nzapa amû na azo mbeni yingo-ti-hinga so, tongana a leke ni nzoni, ayeke pusu ala ti sala ye na mbage ti amba ti ala tongana ti so ala mveni aye a sala na ala.	Lies destroy friendships and marriages; they defraud people of countless millions of dollars.	476	14 How should these anointed ones view themselves as they await their heavenly reward?	614
Mbi hunda a-oko tënë so na pasteur ti mbi.	Would adjusting your focus or goals allow you to acquire more wisdom?	867	Pharaoh even decrees death for all Israelite male infants.	206
Ye oko, mara ti tënë tongaso ayeke na lege ni ape.	You brought your wisdom to ruin on account of your beaming splendor.”	751	What organization exists in heaven?	729
Ye oko, Paul atene nga, lo tene: “Me na lege ti kota nzobe ti Nzapa mbi ga zo so ala yeke bâ lo fadeso.” (1 aCor. 15:9, 10). Jéhovah ahinga so Paul ayeke mbilimbili-kue ape. Me lo ye Paul, na lo ye ti tene Paul adë kite na ni ape.	(1 Thess. 2:7, 8) When elders are called upon to give counsel, their goal is to do so “with mildness,” even when speaking with those “not favorably disposed.” (2 Tim. 2:24, 25) Elders should also be gracious in expressing themselves in written correspondence when it is necessary to correspond with another body of elders or with the branch office.	238	Still, I saw no spiritual change in my husband.	264
MO YEKE mû peut-être mingi ti angoi ti mo ti bi bê na ndo seni ti mo na lege ti mitele.	Let us, then, examine some of the facets of Jehovah’s matchless love.	112	WHAT WILL HAPPEN JUST BEFORE THE END?	718
Zo ayeke na ngangu ti zi sarango sioni ape.	PAGE 24	578	(1 Corinthians 5:11-13; 1 Timothy 5:20) Writing about his jealous feelings for fellow believers in the Corinthian congregation, Paul said: “I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, for I personally promised you in marriage to one husband that I might present you as a chaste virgin to the Christ.” (2 Corinthians 11:2) So, too, our jealousy moves us to do all we can to protect the doctrinal, spiritual, and moral purity of all in the congregation.	450
Na France, tongana a mû azo 10 so akui, oko akui kuâ ti manga.	Nathan was very progressive, always planning ahead for future growth.	179	Onlookers might agree.	141
Na lege kue so azi, a lingbi e sala ngangu kue ti wara tâ hingango ye kue so bê ti Nzapa aye nga ye so lo leke ti sala.	But we can do so in a figurative sense.	315	As Job well knew, God’s will is to resurrect the dead.	193

These principles were a comfort to the psalmist, as they can be for God’s servants who are struggling to deal with the difficulties of modern life. 5.	782	In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”	478
Tongana zo so mo yeke manda Bible na lo ahunda tënë na bê ti lo kue na ndo ambeni kota tënë so ala yeke manda na yâ Bible, tongana nyen mo lingbi ti wara atënë mingi na yâ Bible so alingbi ti mû lege na mo ti kiri tënë nzoni na ahundango tënë so?

Na ngoi so aita ayeke manda Tour ti Ba Ndo so a yeke sara yenga oko oko, ambeni molenge-koli abo ndo na yâ ti da so amissionnaire alango dä na akota tênë.	It might be said that while God’s laws test our obedience, his principles test the depth of our spirituality and of our desire to please him.	330	For instance, imagine how Abraham must have felt as he made a three-day journey to Moriah in obedience to God’s command: “Take, please, your son, your only son whom you so love, Isaac, and make a trip to the land of Moriah and there offer him up as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall designate to you.”​—Gen. 22:2-4.	366
Ye so ayeke duti ande tâ tënë biani na ngoi so Jéhovah ayeke ga ti hunzi sioni sese ti Satan!	They will not know that they are serving as God’s means for executing his righteous judgment against an unfaithful people.	559	(Isa. 45:18; 55:10, 11) Why, the rendering of sacred service to Jehovah would cease on earth if no humans were left to worship him in the earthly courtyards of his great spiritual temple!	749
(Jean 15:15) Mingi ti azo ayeke na ngia tongana a diko ala andeko ti azo so ayeke na ngangu wala akota zo, me a lingbi ti diko e tongana andeko ti azo use ti kota ahon kue ti ndagigi!	Learning to Fear Jehovah	208	Unfortunately, because of corruption and bureaucratic red tape, a large part of the funds provided by governments, international agencies, and individuals never reaches the people who really need it.	684
Ala yeke gi nga ti wara gbâ ti azo na lege so ala yeke sara si fini ti azo ni aga nzoni nga ala yeke leke ahôpital, a-ekole nga na ada teti awayere.	On one occasion, Jesus Christ spoke about the need to pray and “not to give up.”	42	(Psalm 34:20; Zechariah 12:10; John 19:33-37) These are but a few examples of Messianic prophecies applied to Jesus by divinely inspired Bible writers.*	514
Tongana nyen?	I had to try to return the money.”	263	What did Jesus mean when he told Nicodemus: “No man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man”?​—John 3:13.	632
Mungo terê na Nzapa ayeke mbeni kpengba zendo so e mû ti sara na Jéhovah atâa nyen la asi.	(John 12:31) Like wind that whips up dust and litter, “the spirit of the world” stirs up hurtful desires that corrode love and cater to the weaknesses of the flesh.​—Galatians 5:19-21.	21	The lack of spiritual exercise eventually weakens, even deadens, what faith he might once have had.	848
Ala sala “tënë ti kirikiri si adisciple ague na peko ti ala.”	Then he bound me with ropes and put me in a room with prisoners who had been caught with stolen goods in their possession.	144	Thomas Emlyn (scholar), 4/1	278

Mo lingbi ti zia bê kue na yâ azendo kue so ayeke na yâ Bible, teti so Lingu ni ayeke ‘Jéhovah Nzapa ti tâ tënë!’​—Psaume 31:6.	Why does the expression “man of lawlessness” fit Christendom’s clergy?	978	Do you at times feel “broken at heart” and “crushed in spirit”?	955
Bê ti e apusu e ti ndoye Babâ ti e ti yayu mingi, lo so amû na e pendere beku ti zingongo akuâ.	The man had a jug of cool water and offered me a drink.	833	Still, many millions of imperfect humans have succeeded in doing so.	920
Kite ayeke dä pëpe so e kue e wara ye ti nzoni na lege ti Ekole ti Kusala ti aChrétien so a yeke sara na yâ ti akongregation ti e.	On one occasion, he said: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”	961	(Ruth 1:9; Ephesians 3:14, 15) Children too are a precious “inheritance from Jehovah,” bringing joy to parents who successfully instill godly qualities in them.	235

Ngele ti i ayeke ngangu mingi ahon ngele ti andeke pëpe?	Like the apostles of old, we are for the most part unlettered and ordinary.	248	Then he bound me with ropes and put me in a room with prisoners who had been caught with stolen goods in their possession.	136
Ndeko ti lo ayeke mbeni nzapa so ayeke na adidi.	We will never know everything about the wisdom of God’s ways.	539	18 As noted, a mature Christian can be a powerful influence for good in the congregation.	115
3, 4. (a) Ngbanga ti nyen la Jéhovah akanga bê? (b) Na ngoi so Adam na Ève ake yanga, nyen la Jéhovah asara?	Heartfelt, specific prayers can make a powerful impression on young minds.	659	Those who believe in miracles are convinced that they occur and perhaps occur often.* For example, it is reported that in Greece during the last few years, believers have claimed that miracles take place about once a month.	704
A tokua ambeni ita-koli ni ti sala kusala na aplace ti mine. Kâ, ala tingbi na aTémoin so ayeke na kanga pëpe, na aTémoin ni amû na ala apériodique.

A fâ ngbanga ti kanga ti ngu omene na li ti mbi; mbi yeke sala kanga ni na Budapest.	Their sincere concern for his welfare​—their self-sacrificing love—​moved them to act swiftly in his behalf, opening the way for the jailer and his entire household to become believers.	98	Jesus felt power flow from him, but he did not see who had been cured.	272
Ti tene akoli atene “Mbi ye mo” na awali, wala na amolenge ti ala, tënë ni alingbi ti ne nengo na yanga ti ala.	Bible Can Help Marriage, 9/15	472	6 Paul wrote to Timothy: “Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”	568
Bible atene pëpe so a fâ ngbanga ti sioni na ndo salango ye ti azo ti Jabès ti Galaad so, na bango ni, akpa salango place ti kuâ ti Gbia Saül.	(Acts 16:5) The 3,513 Witnesses in Albania still have much work to do.	995	We may deceive even ourselves, “thinking that godly devotion is a means of [material] gain.”	794
Gbâ ti azo la ayeke sö kuâ ande “na yâ ti kota ye ti vundu”.	They are of fundamental importance and are likely among the first truths we learned when we began to study God’s Word.	361	Jesus no doubt cherished Mary’s support during the eventful years that followed.	711

A lingbi e zia ye kue na maboko ti Jéhovah.	Do not let the distress this brings cause you to forget the joyful prospect of personally experiencing the resurrection and coming to life again with renewed health and vigor in the new world.	362	(Proverbs 3:21-23) Above all, they now entertain a hope “both sure and firm” for the future.	196

16 E yeke na beku ti kiri ti bâ tere na afami ti e so akui (Jean 5:28, 29).	Jehovah used Isaiah to convey a reassuring message.	802	(Daniel 12:4; 2 Timothy 3:1) Until this day, that watchman class​—anointed Christians, the Israel of God—​has been acting in harmony with Isaiah’s description of the prophetic watchman: “He paid strict attention, with much attentiveness.	0

However, Jesus never desired such a future because it was not Jehovah’s will for him.	656	(Revelation 18:21) What heavenly rejoicing there will be when this happens, when the world empire of false religion is destroyed!​—Revelation 19:1, 2.	503

Luke further states that the Jews at this time “were in expectation” of the Messiah’s arrival.	998
Kota ye so agbu bê ti atâ Chrétien ayeke ti nzere na lê ti Nzapa, me pëpe ti “ga nzoni na lê ti azo na lege ti mitele”.​—aGalate 6:12.	Why else would Jehovah command the kings of Israel to make a personal written copy of the Law?	268	(Ps. 55:2-5) Nevertheless, he did not allow anxiety to destroy his confidence in Jehovah.	198
Pakara Martin Rees, so ayeke nga mbeni wandara, atene: “Ambeni ye ayeke dä so peut-être azo ayeke hinga ye lâ oko ape na ndo ni.”	Before long he was a drug addict, robbing people to pay for his vice.	347	How is modesty related to humility?	700

(Revelation 18:21) What heavenly rejoicing there will be when this happens, when the world empire of false religion is destroyed!​—Revelation 19:1, 2.	160	This headline in the newsletter Emerging Trends summarized the results of a nationwide poll in the United States.	962
Ye oko, na yâ ti sambela ti lo so a fa pekoni na Psaume 22:17-22, a yeke polele so mabe ti lo na Nzapa atï pëpe.	19 Are you heeding Jesus’ advice to keep your eye “simple”?	335	So I decided to do my best to spread the good news.	407
Lo tene: “Mbi ga ye kue ndali ti mara ti azo nde nde kue, si na yâ ti ye kue mbi sö fini ti ambeni.” (1 aCor. 9:20-22). Legeoko tongana ti Paul, e lingbi ti wara ambeni li ti tënë so e na azo ti territoire ti e amä tere dä?	(Read.)	514	And much may be learned from what is not said.	569

Contacting them or submitting to their influence is not to be taken lightly, for they, just like their leader, Satan the Devil, would like to devour us.	32	They trusted in Jehovah. Were they blessed? Absolutely!	102
Me, pango ndo ayeke tenengo tënë ti mvene na ndo ti mbeni zo ti buba iri ti lo.	However, motivated by our desire to serve Jehovah wherever we could be used best, we tackled this new assignment, with his blessing.	23	Would she like to come with me?	374

Azo ti Israël ayeke mû mbage ti azo ti kengo yanga so!	(Mark 12:31) Did Jesus place a limit on loving our neighbor based on where that neighbor lives or on what nationality he is?	605	The Congregation Service Committee should promptly assign you to a field service group.	780

Ye oko, akusala ti e ayeke fä ti mabe so asala kusala, na so e yeke na ni na yâ azendo ti Nzapa.​—aRomain 3:23, 24; Jacques 2:17, 18, 24.	We therefore appreciate it when others respect our time, showing reasonableness when they approach us and in the amount of our time that they take.	914	Now, though, Miriam might have become unduly concerned about losing some of her prominence to a suspected rival, the wife of Moses.	656
Wala même kozo na matanga ni, lo lingbi ti tene na wali ti lo so na ngoi so lo yeke sigigi ti vo ye, a lingbi lo vo ambeni ye teti lo: akobe so ayeke gi teti matanga ni, aye ti mu na matabisi, wala akugbe ti kangango na ye nga na a-carte teti aye so lo ye ti mu na matabisi.	In the same way, when preaching the Kingdom message, caring publishers give support to all responsive ones who are suffering in some way.	639	Even though they lived in a world that was geared toward making their primary pursuit in life, building the ark, seem trivial, misguided, or foolish, they still kept at it faithfully.	628
So siokpari ayeke na tere ti e, e lingbi tâ gi na kuâ (Ps. 103:10).	Rather than risking that outcome, we might forgo the opportunity to conduct a study.	388	Though they were 10,000 strong, their faith and courage would face a great test this day.	895
Lo ga ti fa tënë ti témoin ti tâ tënë.	In preaching to these Greek-speaking people, Paul often quoted or paraphrased portions of that translation.​—Genesis 22:18, footnote; Galatians 3:8.	753	If we have such a relationship with God, we will never ask, ‘Will I still be serving Jehovah in a few years’ time?’	922
Ti sara ngangu andu nga ti bata bê ti e si asioni nzara alï dä pëpe.	Jesus’ words bring to mind what King David of ancient Israel was inspired to write centuries earlier: “The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”​—Psalm 37:11, KJ.	541	He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the readjustment of the holy ones, for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ.”​—Ephesians 4:8, 11, 12.	758
1 octobre 2013	Likewise, it is not right for us to allow personal pursuits or time-consuming distractions to prevent us from having a full share in the ministry.	494	But it is not bribery to give a tip or a gift to a public servant when he performs his duty or to obtain a legitimate service or to avoid unfair treatment.​—4/1, page 29.	513
Ndoye ti Nzapa teti azo ti lo so li ti ala akpengba	Jonah came to have Jehovah’s view of the repentant Ninevites	613	(Matt. 13:23) Let us see how doing so can help you to strengthen your faith in God as the Creator and in the Bible​—topics on which there is no shortage of “convincing evidence.”​—Heb. 11:1, ftn.	353
(Ps. 18:2). A lingbi e ndoye Nzapa nga tongaso ndali ti so lo ye e mingi.	16 Humility and modesty help a married person focus on the strengths of his or her mate.	106	Thus, Ecclesiastes 7:9 must mean that we should refrain from taking offense at the relatively minor sins of others.	179
Me, ti bâ akamarade ti Nzapa tongana awato ti e, a yeke na lege ni ape.—Psaume 141:5.	However, the greatest evidence that Paul did not compromise his faith is seen in his continuing to have Jehovah’s approval.	163	We can gain insight into this by a careful consideration of Mark chapter 6.	818
10 Ye nyen Paul ayeke sala lani tongana lo ye ti fa atâ tënë ti Mbeti ti Nzapa so alï mingi na awamango lo?	Our spiritual vision can become blurred, or out of focus, so that we fail to discern his crafty acts.	60	Maybe you detected a fear of man, a longing for prominence or luxury, or even an inclination toward stubbornness or independence.	428
Mû tapande ti Jésus: Fa ye na ndoye	“I go online only while others are around”	848	Later, followers of Jesus were also anointed and begotten by holy spirit.	855
Ni la, a yeke polele so azo so ayeke sara aye ti pitan na ala ke ti changé lege ti ala, a yeke zi lege pëpe na ala ti duti na yâ ti fini sese ti Nzapa.	So after much prayer, I decided that I should stay to help care for Joan.	115	So in November 1990, I began serving in Béziers as a pioneer.​—Psalm 94:17-19.	511
E lingbi même ti bâ so e lingbi pëpe na mbeni futa.	Susan is a strong, spiritual woman.	170	The apostle Paul acknowledged: “There is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are.” (1 Corinthians 8:6; Isaiah 42:8) Another reason that Jehovah is “the true one” referred to at 1 John 5:20 is that he is the Source of truth.	928
5:1-5; 2 aCor. 2:6-8). Bible asara tënë ti azo so asara akota siokpari me so achangé bê ti ala na Nzapa apardone ala.​—2 Chron. 33:2, 10-13; 1 aCor. 6:9-11.	● “He was an ordinary man who lived an extraordinary life.”	431	He then picked up the jawbone of an ass and struck down a thousand foes with it.​—Judges 15:10-15.	933
Tongana nyen Jéhovah afa yeke yeke tënë ti ndagigi wala tënë so a honde ti ye so lo leke ti sara?	(2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11) Unlike them, he could point to proof of his apostleship​—to imprisonment, beatings, perilous journeys, other dangers, hunger, thirst, and sleepless nights, as well as deep concern for fellow believers.	489	Representatives of the governing body were sent out to the congregations to deliver the letter.	793
(Psaume 19:14 [19:13, NW]) Na mungo tapande ti akoli tongana Paul, Guidéôn, nga ti lo so ayeke kota ahon atanga ni kue, Jésus Christ, fade e mveni e yeke ba tâ tene ti atene so: “Ndara ayeke na azo so ahinga katikati ti ala.”​—aProverbe 11:2, NW.	THROUGHOUT the Bible, we find statements indicating that Jehovah wants us not only to live but also to enjoy life.	394	(See paragraph 20)	34
A si na mbeni ngoi, na ngu 96 tongaso, na yâ ti aye so bazengele Jean asû na yâ ti mbeti ti Apocalypse, lo bâ so “fini sese” ni ague oko na aye ti nzoni so Royaume ti Nzapa ayeke ga ande na ni (Apocalypse 21:1-4).	(Nehemiah 8:8) All our meetings begin and end with prayer, and at most of them, we sing songs of praise to Jehovah.	278	They looked forward to the execution of divine judgment against the wicked and apparently were those addressed with the words: “‘Keep yourselves in expectation of me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘till the day of my rising up to the booty, for my judicial decision is to gather nations, for me to collect together kingdoms, in order to pour out upon them my denunciation, all my burning anger; for by the fire of my zeal all the earth will be devoured.’”​—Zephaniah 3:8.	26
Lo hinga so Jéhovah amû yanga na Adam na Eve ti dü na ti mû lê ti sese kue, si na nda ni a wara na ndo ti sese kue gi anzoni zo so ayeke voro gi Jéhovah so asala ala (Genèse 1:28).	Also, serving “shoulder to shoulder” in the ministry produces a united spirit in the congregation.​—Read Zephaniah 3:9.	579	The few individuals with whom God had dealings personally​—Noah, Moses, Jesus, and others—​were, in fact, used by Him to communicate with a closely associated group.	647
Tënë ti Markus na Janny Hartlief	Yes, nothing is wasted as these silent workers prepare the soil for new growth.	409	This sounded more reasonable, and I started attending their religious meetings.	824
[Foto na lembeti 27]	(Isaiah 11:9) Jesus will have eliminated the cause of poverty.	410	So had Paul been arrested by the Jewish temple police instead of by Lysias, the Sanhedrin could have tried and sentenced him without a problem.	435
“Fade Mbi wa mo, na Mbi fa na mo lege so alingbi mo tambela dä; fade Mbi wa mo, na lê ti Mbi angbâ na ndo mo.”​—PSAUME 32:8.	Missionary service is not about you.	592	They Do Not Give Up 8.	586

What is God’s will for the “great crowd”?	745	“He that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”​—HEBREWS 11:6	917
Ti tene a fâ yâ ti lisoro ni pepe, lo kanga singa ti lo.	9 Prove Bible truth to yourself. Our sense of identity as servants of Jehovah can weaken if it is not solidly based on knowledge of the Scriptures.	664	4 Perhaps there have been times in your life when you felt that you, like Paul, were following the leadings of God’s holy spirit, but then things did not turn out the way you expected.	5
Agbiango ye wa alingbi ti duti mbeni kpale teti nzoni duti ti e na lege ti yingo?	He also related how Jehovah’s Witnesses have helped to inform doctors about bloodless treatment techniques.	932	(Acts 2:24) If we accept that there is a God and that he is the Creator of all things, then we have every reason to believe that he could raise his Son from the dead.​—Hebrews 3:4.	426
FADE KOBELA AYEKE MBENI PËPE:	Her role is reflected in the way she communicates.	95	We will never know everything about the wisdom of God’s ways.	145
Fade lo yeke wara “futa” ti kota ahon pëpe, so ti tene ngangu sengo ndo?	He said, “You are free to go.”	274	According to Psalm 26:4, David sang: “I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in.”	80
Akota zo ti a-eglize so atene ala yeke aChrétien nga na ti ambeni bungbi ti nzapa ayeke sara ti ala ande nyen na yâ ti tënë so?	Two days later, Paul sent me a copy of The Watchtower.	448	Jesus’ words bring to mind what King David of ancient Israel was inspired to write centuries earlier: “The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”​—Psalm 37:11, KJ.	519
Kete na pekoni, lo gbian bango ndo ti lo na lo wara sava ti tere (2 aGbia 5:9-14).	Do you have a meaningful share in that work?	584	No human knows the “day and hour” when that will come. (Matt. 24:36) At this time, we have the God-given work of warning people and telling them how they can be saved.	715
Ti sara ye alingbi na ni, a lingbi ala vo ye tongana ti kozo ape.	“Carry on with one another loving-kindness.”​—ZECHARIAH 7:9. 1, 2. (a) Why should we display loving-kindness? (b) What questions will we consider?	336	Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.	668
Nyen la alingbi ti si tongana e zia lê ti e gi na ndo ti aye so agbu bê ti e?	Do you not find this approach on Jehovah’s part heartwarming?	756	That was the equivalent of what an unskilled laborer might earn for 25 days’ work.	404
A fa so Jéhovah ayeke gboto azo na mbage ti lo ngbanga ti so lo bâ mbeni nzoni ye na yâ ti bê ti ala na lo yeke pensé na ala.	But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.”​—Col. 3:12-14.	141	Drinking wine was obviously acceptable to Jesus.	100
6-12 AVRIL 2009	In time, though, he made progress.	604	It’s a time for us to put the stress of daily life on hold and focus on our spirituality.	673
Mo lingbi ti hinga ndani so a lingbi e sara tongaso na lege ti mbeni tënë so Jérémie atene na ndo ti bê.	LIFE STORY	651	How does Jehovah teach his people to manifest compassion?	763
[Foto na lembeti 31]	(John 5:28, 29) What does that prospect do for the surviving mate?	97	Even the most simple and commonplace circumstance was thought to conceal within itself the most recondite [hidden] truth . . . , even in the number of fish caught by the disciples on the night the risen Saviour appeared to them​—how much some have tried to make of that number, 153!”	358
Zia e fa na gigi ndoye teti atâ tënë so e fa	They would likely wonder whether the God of their forefathers could deliver them.	789	5 Nonetheless, the faithful and discreet slave went through the same tests as “that evil slave.”	83

A hunda na azo miombe na popo ti e ti sara kua na yâ ti acamp ti sarango akua ti ngangu teti ngu 130.	(Acts 2:15; 1 Thessalonians 5:7) Hence, both the groom and the trustworthy Christian he designates as director of the feast ought to make sure that all present follow the clear directive: “Do not be getting drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery.”​—Ephesians 5:18; Proverbs 20:1; Hosea 4:11.	744	Helping Peter and the others present to imagine the future, Jesus responded: “Truly I say to you, in the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.	191
So aye ti tene so a lingbi e zia bê ti e na aita ti e ape nga e yeke na kite na ndo ti dutingo be-ta-zo ti ala na Jéhovah?	“Love is envy’s great enemy,” says sociologist Francesco Alberoni.	368	In his perfect wisdom, Jehovah God decided to allow the rebellion to proceed for a limited time.	150
Na pekoni, ye so ayeke sara si mo mû ngia na bê ti Jéhovah ahon ti kozo, mo sara ye na lege ni na mbage ti azo nga mo ngbâ ti sara aye ti nzoni.	He may also be less inhibited in expressing perverse thoughts and desires that are normally suppressed.	695	It shook, it cracked, and then it fell​—crashing to the ground!	239
(1 Pierre 4:11) Azo so agi ngangu teti ala mveni aga azo ti fandara.	You can also start a research project.	580	Why will the resurrection glorify Jehovah’s name?	438
22 Zo ti kota ahon atanga ni kue so a dü lo lani na Bethléhem ayeke zo wa?	Perhaps a doctor or a nurse said them before administering a recommended treatment.	178	Why is that?	33
Ange ti Jéhovah aga na wali masia Marie, na lo tene: “Zia mbito, Marie, teti mo wara grâce na lê ti Nzapa. Bâ, fade mo më ngo na mo dü Molenge-koli, na fade mo di iri ti Lo Jésus.”	(Col. 1:15) Even before coming to earth, Jesus chose to remain loyal to his Father and not join Satan in his rebellion.	102	When such elders help the local brothers to become spiritual shepherds, the entire congregation will continue to benefit from the work of “need greaters” even after they move away to another congregation.	305
Na popo ti atënë ni so, lo so agbu bê ti mbi mingi ahon atanga ni kue ayeke tënë ti gango ti Royaume ti Jéhovah (Daniel 2:44).	We do well to heed the words of the apostle Peter, who urged fellow believers: “Honor men of all sorts, have love for the whole association of brothers.”​—1 Pet. 2:17.	903	Indeed, we are assured: “He is not far off from each one of us.”	252
A yeke “na lege ti yingo vulu” la lo mû ngo so.​—Mat. 1:20.	It reads: “God himself will be with them.	911	Traditionally, we had been part of a matrilineal system, in which children were considered part of the mother’s family.	307
13 Mawa ni ayeke so, mara ti Israël ‘abata lani pëpe akomandema so kue na gbele Jéhovah’ na tongaso adeba nzoni so a mû zendo ni na ala, ala wara ni pëpe.	No other human has ever received a comparable assignment.	270	They will not know that they are serving as God’s means for executing his righteous judgment against an unfaithful people.	131
(Genèse 22:18; 26:24; 28:10-14; 49:10; 2 Samuel 7:16) Na mbeni lege nde wa molenge so Marie ayeke dü alingbi ande ti duti tâ héritier ti azendo ti Nzapa so?	“IF YOU put forth sincere effort and show that you want your marriage to succeed, you can enjoy Jehovah’s blessing,” says a husband who has been happily married for 38 years.	303	(Luke 4:16) For Joe, an elder with a large family who works long hours, habit has helped to create in him a need and a desire to attend meetings regularly.	609
LEMBETI 14	A needy Christian should not be too proud to accept the loving assistance of fellow believers or any governmental aid he or she may qualify for.	904	Because we have faith in God’s prophetic word, we are convinced that we are now deep in “the time of the end.”	579
Na lege ti nzoni sarango ye ti e, e yeke fa na lo so e kiri merci mingi ndali ti ngangu so mênë ti Jésus ayeke na ni ti sö e.	(1 Sam. 26:8-11) Because David kept seeking God’s guidance, he did not waver in his determination to act in accord with Jehovah’s will despite the urgings of Abishai.	236	But the fact that they spend more time in the ministry does not make them feel superior to their brothers and sisters.	28
Babâ ti ala afa tënë ti Jéhovah na ala na ngoi so ala de foroto na ala wara batême na ngoi so ala yeke maseka.	Yes, empathy involves our feeling another person’s pain in our heart.	262	When our words and deeds are guided by wisdom, we have the “riches and glory” that exist with wisdom.	311
43:32​—Ngbanga ti nyen a yeke lani sioni na lê ti azo ti Egypte ti te kobe legeoko na aHébreu?	Seeing how well the people responded to the Kingdom message we shared with them gave me so much joy.	601	COVER: Faithful Witnesses use boats to reach some of the people living on islands of the Bocas del Toro Archipelago off the northwest coast of Panama.	881
Lo tene pëpe: “Mbi londo na yayu la mbi ga, tongaso a lingbi ala mä mbi si.”	Where God’s Law was definite, it meant what it said.	76	Consider a young girl who moved to a rural town to help people to learn about God’s Word.	471
(Diko Matthieu 5:11, 12.)	Though space limits our discussing those reasons here, there are two facts that can give us hope and encouragement.	595	But what about our conscience?	37
Na tapande, na Canada, tongana a mû akoli bale-oko, ota tongaso na popo ni ayeke bâ pasi na lege so awali ti ala ayeke pika ala.	Such negative feelings may pose a serious danger to a Christian’s relationship with Jehovah. 3.	872	If the person respects God’s Word and is honesthearted, such reasoning may move him to examine the subject further.​—Acts 17:11.	168
Ye oko, lo hinga so mbeni zo nde ayeke nga na gunda ti aye ti sioni so ayeke na bê ti ala.	6 Paul wrote to Timothy: “Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”	152	The Pharisees start to belittle them: “You have not been misled also, have you?	200
Azo ti Jéhovah so A Kiri Ala na Ndo ti Ala Asepela Lo na Ndo Sese Kue, 1/3	And much may be learned from what is not said.	505	The same may have been true of Daniel’s three companions, who were also given positions of authority.​—Dan. 2:49.	183

(The Battle for God​—Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam) But is it only the “fundamentalist” brand of religion that has failed this test and become “a theology of rage and hatred”?	943	5 For good reason, Jehovah gave Habakkuk this rousing commission: “Write down the vision, and set it out plainly upon tablets, in order that the one reading aloud from it may do so fluently.	571

Is there a religion that is different​—one that can unite mankind?	696	(Acts 2:15; 1 Thessalonians 5:7) Hence, both the groom and the trustworthy Christian he designates as director of the feast ought to make sure that all present follow the clear directive: “Do not be getting drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery.”​—Ephesians 5:18; Proverbs 20:1; Hosea 4:11.	551

ENJOY DOING WHAT YOU CAN	302	When we draw close to Jehovah, it is only natural that we want to use our time, energy, and resources to share as fully as possible in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. (Matthew 28:19, 20) At times, we may feel that we are accomplishing little.	582

God here promises that death will be no more, which suggests that the children who might be born then will not have to face the prospect of growing up and then getting old​—ending in death.	676	(Isa. 6:8) This multitude of individuals echo the truthfulness of the words of the circuit overseer who long ago said to me: “Get right into the full-time ministry.	657

About 1991, I realized after analyzing my situation that the best way to avoid giving in to self-pity was to keep busy in sharing the precious Kingdom good news with others.	877	Small wonder, therefore, that the German newsmagazine FOCUS compared the world’s major religions​—Buddhism, Christendom, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism—​to gunpowder.	283

The apostle Paul acknowledged: “There is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are.” (1 Corinthians 8:6; Isaiah 42:8) Another reason that Jehovah is “the true one” referred to at 1 John 5:20 is that he is the Source of truth.	527	For instance, the apostle Paul urged his fellow Christian overseer Timothy: “Do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Timothy 4:5) Today, one way an overseer accomplishes his ministry is by being a zealous Kingdom proclaimer, one who shares regularly in the field ministry.	169

We realize that should we die before Armageddon, a continued course of conduct displeasing to Jehovah could put us in the same position as those who have no prospect of a resurrection.	777	Why should we not automatically equate suffering with improper conduct? 14 Granted, problems may arise if we sow according to the flesh rather than the spirit.	597

A-Romain 8:22 atene: “E hinga so juska fadeso création kue angbâ gi ti dema legeoko na ti bâ pasi legeoko.”	And the apostle Peter wrote: “You [anointed Christians] know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were delivered from your fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from your forefathers. But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.”​—1 Peter 1:18, 19.	91	(The Battle for God​—Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam) But is it only the “fundamentalist” brand of religion that has failed this test and become “a theology of rage and hatred”?	741
14 Mbeni koli na wali so iri ti ala ayeke Michel na Diane amanda tongana nyen mungo maboko ti aita ti ala ti koli na ti wali alingbi ti duti ye ti ngele ngangu.

(1 Thessalonians 5:21) We have a clear understanding of the vast difference between Christianity and the world that is alienated from God.	858
Teti biani, bâ gi angoi mingi so mbi mû ti diko Bible na ambeti ti Nzapa na yâ angu so ahon.”	That is so whether we are together at a meeting or in an informal setting.	328	In what way did Saul manifest an impatient attitude?	473

9 Na gbotongo lê mingi na ndo nene ti bata, Jésus ahaka adisciple ti lo na angba so ayeke ku kiringo ti maître ti ala so ague ti sala mariage.	Since the offspring is to crush the serpent’s head, that is, “bring to nothing” the spirit creature Satan the Devil, the offspring would have to be a spirit person.	318	What can be discerned from Galatians 6:2, 5?	924
Akoli na wali so amû tere alingbi ti mä Nzapa.	As a result, we will have loyal friends​—a precious reward indeed!​—Proverbs 18:24.	310	“Oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you.”​—JAMES 4:7.	327

Biani, périodique so lo yeke na ni ayeke fini ni ahon ti so e yeke fa.	The fact is, we can find evidence of Jesus’ existence in what secular historians wrote about him and his followers.	50	6 Accordingly, it does not surprise us that true Christians today have faced gross misrepresentations, malicious slander, and smear campaigns.	868
Na yâ mbeni buku ti lo (The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah), Alfred Edersheim atene: “[Arabbin], ‘awandara ti tënë ti Nzapa,’ atene lani so ti manda mbeti ayeke kota mingi ahon ti sala kusala.”	13.

Anzoni ye ti peko ti salango ye alingbi na tâ tënë	Jesus’ shed blood will provide the basis for mankind’s deliverance from sin and death.​—Heb. 9:12-14.	707	In fact, Jehovah appreciates such effort on your part.	583
Azo so ayeke sara pasi na ala lani ayeke azo ti Égypte (Exode 1:13, 14).	The Bible shows that God pays special attention to “those meditating on [or possibly, “treasuring﻿  his name.”	339	Thus, what may make one sick person feel better may not be helpful to another.	735
