Teti biani, “Nzapa . . . alingbi sala mvene pëpe”.	Lovingly, God provided “long garments of skin” to replace the loin coverings of fig leaves that they had sewn together for themselves. (Genesis 3:7, 21) Rather than leave them in their shame, God treated them with dignity.	191	In the absence of specific laws, how can we know what choices will please Jehovah?	9

In fact, Jesus said: “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.”	685	(Matt. 9:37, 38) For instance, many thousands of our young people who recently graduated from school have expanded their ministry and are now experiencing the joy that comes from zealously serving as pioneers.	968

3 Jéhovah amû yingo ti lo na Daniel ti fa kozoni so na alango ti nda ni, “ala so ayeke na ndara, fade ala hinga nda ti ye”, wala ala hinga tâ tënë.	(Ecclesiastes 7:12) With enough money, we can obtain food and a comfortable home.	19	(1 Pet. 4:3, 4) Of course, we try to avoid offending them, but it is usually best to speak with them in a kind, though straightforward, way.	552
Teti angu mingi, Poto ayeke lani na gbe ti angangu komandema use: Kodoro-togbia ti Rome so a bâ ni tongana nzoni-kue, nga Église Catholique ti Rome.	Jehovah blessed the first ten years of Asa’s reign with complete peace.	537	Using her Bible, she showed me that God does not make people suffer.	829

This can be seen from Daniel’s prophecy involving Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about the chopping down of an immense tree.	893	The fragments illustrated here are portions of the Greek Septuagint that date from the first century B.C.E.

Luca atene: “Mbi yeke tene ka na Manuel ti komanse kua ni, na tongana lo bezoin mbi, lo iri mbi senge.	6 As we look back now, we might well ask ourselves: ‘Am I making progress in my friendship with God?	180	For these, they rightly deserved to be left alone to die.	400
Amos ahunzi ti sû mbeti ti lo na ngu 804 kozo ti Christ na pekoni so lo kiri na Juda.

Ti bi tele na yâ ti nyongo sämba, nyongo mbangi wala ti sala pitan kirikiri ti girisa na vundu ti mo, a yeke lege ti ndara la?	In fact, by the early 1990’s, more than a hundred of their descendants were Witnesses of Jehovah​—all the result of one man’s discovering a single tract on a railroad track!	964	When others speak of their sons, my throat tightens up and I have to hold back tears.”	702
Gï tongana ti so akeke ti vigne so alë anzoni lengo ayeke mû gloire na zo so alu ni, e nga e yeke mû gonda, wala gloire, na Jéhovah tongana e yeke sara kue ti fa tënë ti Royaume alingbi na ngangu ti e.—Mat. 25:20-23.	Thus, while man has dominion over animals, he should not abuse that authority but use it in harmony with the principles of God’s Word.	675	15 Did Moses really need to correct Jehovah’s thinking?	801
Kpengba ye wa la e manda na lege ti azo ti Israël?	The Bible says that Almighty God shows favor to humble individuals “in due time.” (1 Peter 5:6) So if there seems to be a delay in his answering our sincere requests, we need not see this as a lack of interest on Jehovah’s part.	815	(John 8:32-36; 18:37) Because sheeplike ones accept the truth and follow Christ in faith, they will receive everlasting life.​—John 10:24-28.	59

Biani, lo yeke Seigneur na Gbia ti e, me lo yeke nga Lo so asala e nga Babâ ti e (Esaïe 64:8; Matthieu 6:9; Kusala 4:24).

For example, what principles might we discern in the arrangement of cities of refuge?	480	For Christ’s true followers, that involves their whole way of life, including their attitude toward money, secular work, entertainment, worldly customs and celebrations, and marriage and other relationships with fellow humans.	750
A futi bungbi ti aye ti aJuif	Bearing that out, before sending his disciples out into the ministry, Jesus Christ told them: “When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.”	490	Those prophecies were being fulfilled in front of my eyes.	194

Ngu 14 tongaso na pekoni, Nzapa ahunda na Abraham ti fâ ganza nga ti fâ azo ti da ti lo kue na ganza.	Jesus likened God’s utterances to life-sustaining bread.	13	Such training​—whether for children or for adults—​sows the seeds of violence and war.	905
A lingbi e sara hange na tënë ti yanga ti e nga na sarango ye ti e.	Jehovah has satisfied me with a rich and meaningful life.	92	Who will go to heaven, and why?	129

You can rightly view them as such because all individuals who hope in them will be sorely disappointed.​—Read Isaiah 28:15, 17.	894	7 What will help us to resist such negative thinking and thereby maintain a sense of urgency?	140
Mo tene mara ti tënë so lâ oko awe?	[Picture on page 4]	198	How vividly these two examples show that Jehovah our God “treats none with partiality”!​—Deut. 10:17.	641
A yeke nzoni mo na lo amû maboko na mba, nga ala gi ti bâ lege ti molenge ti ala nzoni.​—Zo-ti-fa-tene 4:9, 10.	18, 19. (a) How did Jehovah foretell that he would produce a new people for his name? (b) What will be examined in the following article?	164	(Matthew 4:4; John 4:34) If you talk about emotional wounds each time you open the Bible, you could cause your mate to lose his or her spiritual appetite.	851
Mbeni zo oko ti tene lakue tongaso ayeke pëpe.	Many who knew his former ways were astonished.	257	Larger Nativity scenes with almost life-size figures are often set up near town halls during the Christmas period.	145
Ên ën, a yeke sara tongaso pëpe.	Consider what occurs when fleshly thinking prevails.	552	It was my favorite meeting.	211
Lo wara lege pëpe ti sara lisoro na mbeni zo na ndö ti Bible, a sara si lo tene na ambeni Béthelite, lo tene: “Tanga ti ndo so mbi ye ti sara kodro dä na ndö ti sese ayeke Portugal.”	What warning about pursuing “unrealities” did Samuel deliver?	673	Jesus fully understood the plight of the oppressed.	237
So atâ pendere tapande si e wara na yâ buku ti Ruth!	To unify his people, Jehovah gives them a pure language.	542	A Fine Provision	498
Futa wa a zia na gbele azo so Nzapa adiko ala azo ti mbilimbili? Me ye wa a lingbi ala ngbâ ti sara?	Everyone alive serves some god or other. (Josh. 24:15) Why not take refuge in the only God worth serving?	828	Clearly, there is abundant proof that Jehovah loves us.	164
A yeke tâ na lege ni ti tene na lâ ni kâ Joas ahiri molenge ti lo Jerubbaal, so ti tene “Zia Baal atiri na lo”.​—aJuge 6:25-32.	5 Read Zechariah 5:3, 4.	357	(Acts 17:11) Like those readers, you may need to lift any veil of bias or criticism that might blur your understanding.	172
Ngbanga ti nyen e lingbi ti duti na beku so Jéhovah aye nzoni ti e?	Then he pointed across the valley, saying: ‘There, to your left, lie the ruins of Socoh.’	463	8 Hebrews 13:4 and 1 Corinthians 6:9 establish that God disapproves of both adultery and fornication (Greek, por·neiʹa).	322
(Job 38:31-33) Jéhovah agboto lê ti Job na ndo ambeni nyama: bamara na pakpo, ngasa ti ngonda so aduti na popo ti atene na lele ti ngonda, ngbä na naamo, ngangu mbarata na ngualo.	However, the original-language word for loving-kindness means more than kindness stemming from love.	378	The smallest letter of the Greek alphabet is iota and is evidently similar to the Hebrew י (yod).	607
A yeke duti biani ye senge senge, na nga ye ti vundu, ti zia si sorongo ye ti nzoni na ti sioni aluti na ndo ti mbeni senge ye tongana “senda-ndara na tene ti handa senge” ti sese.

Tongana nyen mo yeke fa peko ti bango li na asuma so Daniel awara na yâ kozo ngu ti komandema ti Belshatsar?

Lâ ayeke tongana fini-koli so asigigi na yâ da ti lo, na lo sala ngia tongana walombe so [akpe loro ti mandako].	This is a mark of “wise persons,” as the scripture shows.	404	For more information about the ransoming value of Jesus’ death, see chapter 5 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?	432
A yeke ti fa na mo ngangu ti Mbi, na ti fa iri ti Mbi na gigi na sese kue.” (Exode 9:13-16).	“No,” he responds, “it is older than most, and it has never been rebuilt.”	729	IS ARMAGEDDON A MAN-MADE DISASTER?	215
(Diko Genèse 3:1-6.)	Only seven missionaries remained.	929	Imagine, then, how you would feel if you learned that you had been lied to about God.	283
2 Bê ti zo ti sungo Psaume 147 apusu lo ti sepela Jéhovah.	The answer goes back to the dawn of human history, when our first parents rebelled against God as Ruler.	569	He sang: “As for me, the drawing near to God is good for me.	377

4 Ambeni wamandango senda-ndara amaï bango ndo so atene zo alingbi lâ oko pëpe ti wara tâ tënë.	In addition, Satan’s rebellion has given Jehovah an opportunity to demonstrate His fine qualities in a more pronounced way.	932	Those alliances too will prove to be “a lie.”	821
Na peko ti so lo sara kusala ti pionnier a hon ngu 14 laso awe, lo tene: “A nzere na mbi mingi ti hinga so Jéhovah apardone mbi awe!”	“How do Jehovah’s Witnesses treat those who are of another faith?”	554	[Picture on page 11]	74
Ambeni zo so bê ti ala aye tënë ti e wala so amä nzoni tënë ti e ayeke gonda e, na mbage ambeni zo so bê ti ala ake e ayeke sala sioni tënë ti e.	What can we do to find true happiness and satisfaction?	196	I look forward to the day when all communication barriers will be removed and all will speak the “pure language”​—the truth about Jehovah God and his purposes—​as part of a united human family.​—Zephaniah 3:9.	70
Bible asara tënë ti dutingo beoko ti aChrétien tongana nyen? E yeke bâ ahundango tënë wa na yâ ti article so?	Now, why would Paul​—a spiritual “giant” who likely was a member of the first-century governing body—​call himself a “miserable man”?	382	7 If God’s law is truly within our inward parts, such qualities as faith, hope, and love will be displayed and will help to nourish the marriage bond.	531
17 Tongana e mû ngoi ti duti na mbeni sewa so aga gango, a yeke nzere na e mingi nga e yeke hinga ngangu so ala sara ti changé asarango ye ti ala ti lingbi na ngobo ti e na e yeke bâ ni na nene ni.

17 Jérémie asû na mbeti: “L’Eternel ayeke ye ti héritier ti mbi; tongaso beku ti mbi ayeke na Lo.	Let us consider these three forms of comfort, one at a time.	859	How would trusting in Jehovah’s promise have aided a person in obeying the law at Deuteronomy 15:7, 8?	942
Andia tongaso abata azo ti Nzapa na akobela so azo ahinga ni na lâ ni kâ pëpe wala so ala wara lege ti gi nda ni pëpe.	Later, I was invited to transfer to the Buxton Congregation, which had very few publishers and needed help.	875	5 Read Zechariah 5:3, 4.	341
Ambeni kota zo ti poroso ayeke sara nga ye tongaso.	I once heard a doctor say: “A disease does not destroy a person; rather, it changes him.”	561	(John 17:16) True Christians remain neutral in conflicts of the world; hence, they are able to enjoy unity even when those around them are at war.	487
14 Na ngoi wa mbeni wali Chrétien alingbi ti ‘kangbi na koli ti lo’?	For the things . . . unseen are everlasting.”—2 Corinthians 4:16-18.	524	Taking a similar view of the death of a faithful Christian may lessen our grief because we know that he is in line for a resurrection.​—Ecclesiastes 7:1.	927
Mingi ti aye so a yeke fa na yâ ti bâbâ ague nde na akpengba-ndia ti Bible na ndo nzoni tambela.	The psalmist David, who was no stranger to adversity, wrote: “Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him, to all those who call upon him in trueness.	883	(Gal. 6:1; Heb. 12:11) Third, elders are commissioned and trained to reassure repentant sinners, helping to ease their pain and guilt.	448
Mbi bâ so tere ti azo anzere mingi, na ngoi so ala wara ambeni mbeti ti e fini fini na yanga ti kodoro ti ala, wala na ngoi so ala yeke he bia na Jéhovah na yanga ti kodoro ti ala (Kus. 2:8, 11).	Through whom, though, would it operate?	151	Jehovah’s promises will come true	83
(Mat. 16:24). Sarango tongaso ayeke sara si e ga nduru na Jéhovah.	Keep in mind that there is a difference between extending a gift for a legitimate service and offering a bribe for an unlawful favor.	905	There are times when we will do well to reconsider a decision and perhaps change it.	146
Jésus akiri tënë, lo tene: “Azo kue so azia da, wala aita ti ala ti koli, wala aita ti ala ti wali, wala babâ, wala mama, wala amolenge, wala yaka, teti iri ti Mbi, fade A mû ye so kue na ala lege ngbangbo oko, na fade ala wara fini ti lakue lakue.” (Matthieu 19:27-29).	The eyes of such unbelievers are ‘veiled’ from the good news.	125	Of course, do not expect your parents to judge matters perfectly when they have to give you guidelines in difficult areas, such as music, entertainment, and grooming.	132
Lo bungbi oko na Joseph ti Arimathée, mbeni oko ti azo ti Sanhédrin, ti leke kuâ ti Jésus teti lungo ni.	Brother Rutherford requested that we arrange conventions in several cities in the western United States and send speakers to try to encourage the friends as much as possible.”	315	Why, though, was it necessary for Jesus to suffer and die?	438
Laso nga, mingi ti awakua ti Nzapa abata ngia ti ala nga ala ngbâ ti fa tënë atâa so a kanga ala senge senge ndali ti mabe ti ala.	“The wages sin pays is death,” wrote the apostle Paul, “but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”	637	They are blessed with having God’s written Word and loving guidance through his anointed class on earth.	181
Bible afa so Nzapa ayeke bi bê ti lo mbilimbili na “ala [so abi bê] ti ala na iri ti Lo.”	Tomorrow go out against them, and Jehovah will be with you.’”​—2 Chronicles 20:15-17.	898	However, we should not conclude that Jehovah is insensitive to any suffering that his servants may experience in the meantime.	840
Tongana mo mû tere ti mo kue na yâ ti kua ti Nzapa, bê ti mo ayeke son mingi tongana ti ambeni zo so ayeke gue na eglize lakue so afa tënë ti bê ti ala na gbe ni ge:	An announcement will also be made if the congregation needs to be informed.	797	(Luke 20:27-33) What relationship will such ones have in the resurrection?	193
Cameron: Me gi bê ti mo ape.	There was no arrangement for divorce or for having more than one mate at the same time.	76	God used what force when he created the earth, and what were some developments during the first three creative days?	596
Zia si tënë ti da ti Jéhovah agbu bê ti mo ngangu! 1/6	Another brother might have feelings of inadequacy about fulfilling an assignment.	558	(Jeremiah 20:2; 37:15; 38:6) He suffered this abuse at the hands of the very people whom he wished to help.	796
Mbeni koli so a pika lo na ndo ti keke legeoko na Jésus atene: “Jésus, dabe ti mo na mbi tongana mo ga na yâ ti royaume ti mo.”	(Read Revelation 13:1, 2.)	715	WHOM AM I APPROACHING?	382
A yeke ti bâ wala ala yeke duti be-ta-zo.	(James 1:27) So stay close to God’s people, never isolating yourself.​—Proverbs 18:1; Romans 14:7.	699	By willingly completing tasks that seem lowly, we show humility and thus follow in the footsteps of Christ.	156
Na lâ ti nda ni so, aye ti ngangu tongana kota pupu ti ngu atï na ndo ti azo gi tongaso.	We would also be resisting and grieving Jehovah, the source of holy spirit.	517	By giving and receiving love, we feel much more secure.	577
Fadeso a yeke wara akomite 21 na yâ kodoro ni kue nga na wungo ti aita 77 so asala kusala na yâ ni.	‘How could that be,’ he wondered, ‘when smaller trees in the vicinity survived?’	109	Helping such people always brings happiness.”	127
Ambeni ahinga na bê ti ala biani so a yeke mä sambela ti ala.	Judging the beasts adversely, God takes rulership away from them and destroys the fourth beast.	181	However, have you considered the possibility that our expectations of God could be based on a faulty premise?	675
B.P. 662, Bangui, R.C.A.	I appreciated how patient and helpful the brothers were in training me.	868	At such moments, I am inclined to isolate myself and give way to weeping and feelings of self-pity.”	964
A yeke gi Nzapa, so ayeke “Gbia ti lakue lakue,” la apeut ti sara si mara ti zendo ni so aga tâ tënë.—1 Timothée 1:17.	(Rom. 13:8-10) This is especially so when we are engaging in Christian activities, such as when we attend meetings or when we share in the preaching work.	732	Example: Jesus prayed in behalf of his followers.​—John 17:9-17.	749
4 Chapitre 11 ti mbeti na aHébreu afa iri ti azo 16 so ayeke na mabe, akoli na awali.	He sang: “As for me, the drawing near to God is good for me.	349	Why is Satan likened to a birdcatcher?	854
Atâa so mbeni zo alingbi pëpe ti vo tâ yengo tele ti aita, mbeni matabisi so e mû ni na bê ti e kue alingbi ti duti mbeni ye so andu bê ti zo.	To whom, then, would the Messiah come?	195	However, the original-language word for loving-kindness means more than kindness stemming from love.	343
Tongana lo wara ngu 40 lo gue ti bâ aita ti lo, amolenge ti Israël.	He has come to know of differences in viewpoint between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome.	443	You can read those chapters in perhaps 15 to 20 minutes, and you will be amazed to find how simple yet powerful Jesus’ words are.	327
4 Jéhovah atene na e polele na yâ ti Bible so lo yeke duti ande na azo so ‘ahon na popo-hoto ti bingo ti kui’.	What Can We Learn From the Archives?	568	Returning to Paul’s defense before Agrippa, notice how Paul ‘handled God’s word aright’ by referring to things stated by Moses and the prophets.​—2 Timothy 2:15.	793
Zia e bâ fadeso tongana nyen ambaï so alingbi ti mû maboko na e ti hinga bibe ti Jéhovah nzoni mingi.	And how did the Father feel as his Son was nailed to a wooden pole and left there to die a slow, agonizing death?	492	• Why is it important to make peace with an offended brother?	563

Mabe ti e na yâ azendo ti lo ayeke yengi pepe.	Sadly, some parents have allowed their children to attend unsupervised parties where several in attendance have been enticed into immorality or other unseemly conduct.	221	8 There was another problem with Israel’s repentance.	423
Na tapande, ala yekia fini tongana ye so ayeke nzoni-kue nga ala yeke bata akpengba-ndia ti nzoni salango ye (Kusala 15:28, 29; 1 aCorinthien 6:9-11). Akozo ye so ala zia na gbele ala ayeke aye ti yingo, pëpe aye ti mitele.	Exposure to Jehovah’s Witnesses	764	Today, he earns much less than before, but he still cares for his family’s needs and is much better able to support the congregation.	866
Mo yeke wara nga âta ti lo, Métushélah nga na kotara ti lo, Jarèd, so akui ngu 366 na peko ti so a dü Noé* (Luc 3:36, 37). A yeke peut-être akoli so na awali ti ala la afa na Noé so Nzapa acréé azo na lo ye ti tene ala dü amolenge amû ndö ti sese kue nga ala voro lo.	I feel truly blessed to have such a rich spiritual heritage.	594	(Genesis 4:6, 7) How loving it is when those having spiritual qualifications try to readjust the erring one in a spirit of mildness! (Galatians 6:1) To succeed in this endeavor, though, it is necessary to act out of concern rather than with a critical spirit.	527
Ambeni mbeti ayeke dä so e yeke manda ni na ngoi ti abungbi pëpe, me a sigigi na ambeti so ndali ti nzoni ti e.	Humans suffer privation, sickness, and loss.	744	He had all the opportunities of the royal court, while other Hebrews were slaves.	176
• Ngbanga ti nyen a hunda na ababâ na mama ti duti na be-nze-pepe me nga ti luti ngangu na yâ mungo maboko na mbeni molenge so aglisa lege?	Similarly, we look to Jehovah in order to discern his will and to gain his favor.	522	Jehovah’s Witnesses are outstanding in this respect because they enjoy protection in familylike congregations around the earth.	167
11 Tongana tele ti e aso, mbeni lege ti fa so e zia bê ti e na Jéhovah ayeke ti hunda lo na yâ sambela ti mû maboko na e ti gbu ngangu.

11 Atënë so aga na pekoni afa polele so Boaz agi bê ti lo mingi ndali ti Ruth nga lo hinga so gigi ayeke ngangu mingi na Ruth ndali ti so lo yeke wande.	(Deuteronomy 11:8) At Leviticus 20:22, 24, that same land is mentioned: “You people must keep all my statutes and all my judicial decisions and do them, that the land to which I am bringing you to dwell in it may not vomit you out.	414	12 The Greek term translated “setting things straight” means “to make good, to correct, to restore to a proper, upright condition.”	104
(Mat. 27:12-14). Jésus azonga pëpe azo so abi tënë na li ti lo.​—aRom.	When we allow personal differences to cause disunity, we have provided “the birdcatcher” a foothold.	790	That sign would mark “the conclusion of the system of things” and lead to the time when “the end will come.”	280
“Ti kpe mbito ti Nzapa ayeke ndara”	Even though the male publisher is not yet baptized, outsiders identify him with the congregation because of his preaching activity.	966	Among them were my uncles Abdullah and George Ghantous.	746

The Bible refers to the Law given to Israel as “the Law of Moses.” (1 Ki. 2:3) Nevertheless, the Scriptures identify Jehovah as the actual Lawgiver, and Moses himself was subject to that Law.	945	(Galatians 6:4) A man named Edmond, who has been married twice, puts it this way, “Just as no two friendships are the same, so no two marriages are the same.”	678
Ni la a yeke na lege ni si Tënë ti Nzapa awa e, atene: “I duti na donzi.” (1 Pierre 1:13). Tënë ti Grec so a kiri peko ni na “duti na donzi” aye ti tene “duti na lê so akpengba”.

I was greatly impressed by the international brotherhood of Jehovah’s people.	479	(Psalm 22:10) Strong families do things together as a unit​—even if parents must sacrifice time that could be used to personal advantage.	65
Mbeni lâ, Jéhovah asara tënë ti Jésus, lo tene lo yeke “Molenge ti mbi so mbi ndoye lo mingi, lo so bê ti mbi anzere na lo mingi.”	See Daniel 4:23-25.	132	17 Sandi, a Witness in the United States, also shows personal interest in those to whom she preaches.	476
Cyprien, mbeni wandara ti atënë ti vorongo so ayeke na fini na popo ti ngu 200 na ngu 300, asû na mbeti: “Mbeni sambela wa abâ aye ti yingo na nene mingi ahon sambela so Christ afa ni na e . . .?	For these, they rightly deserved to be left alone to die.	300	Jehovah later referred to Jesus as “my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”	640
Desizion so Moïse amû azi lo na yâ ti akpale mingi.	However, he left some clues that might explain this Pharisee’s indecision.	544	These were not pleasure cruises.	696
Tongana e yeke zia ngia na bê ti Babâ ti e ti yayu na yâ aye kue so e yeke sala, fade e yeke bâ so ngia ti e mveni ayeke ga kota.	6, 7. (a) To what might we compare the storm and waves that surrounded Peter? (b) Why should we take seriously the possibility that our faith could diminish?	43	Naomi’s widowed daughter-in-law Ruth became the wife of Boaz and gave birth to a son.	874
“Amolenge ti Nzapa abâ amolenge-wali ti azo”	(Revelation 20:10) Do not let Satan succeed in this scheme to destroy your faith.	931	Jerusalem was to become “like a booth in a vineyard”	394
I gi L’Eternel, i azo ti tâ be-ti-molenge so ayeke na ndo sese, i so i bata kpengba-tene ti Lo.	While there, he asked a Witness to study the Bible with him.	975	This is a mark of “wise persons,” as the scripture shows.	346
Atâa so lo hinga lani pëpe “wali so”, nga na “hale ti lo” ni, Abel abâ peut-être so ‘ti mboko ndagere’ ti hale ti wali ni, a yeke hunda ti tene a sa mênë.	11 “Handling the word of the truth aright” involves more than explaining Scriptural truths accurately.	809	13 Genesis chapters 1 and 2 show that Jehovah took great care to prepare the earth for human habitation.	788
(Psaume 103:20) Ye so ayeke biani tâ tene na ndo kangbingo nzo tene na ngoi ti e.	Is Your Life Too Stressful?	190	(Mic. 5:2) The Messiah was to be born in the Judean town of Bethlehem, evidently once named Ephrathah.	416

A tene na Paul, a tene: “Ga na Macédoine.”	The good news also prevailed over other obstacles, such as persecution.	816	[Picture on page 30]	395
Tongana ti so a fa ni na yâ Mbeti ti Nzapa, tâ vorongo ti aChrétien ayeke nengo ye pëpe.	(Genesis 41:16, 38, 39) By means of his spirit, Jehovah caused his purposes to be revealed to humble ones but hidden from proud ones.	823	These people too need to learn about Jehovah.	278
Na pekoni, na ngbonga gumbaya, mbi sara kua na ndo so a yeke sukula abongo dä, mbi yeke repassé ni.	It will continue to exist forever as a quality of our eternal God.​—1 John 4:8.	113	This visit was enough to convince him that the Bible had the answers to the questions that were troubling him.	555
Dustin na Jassa abâ so ala yeke na aye mingi ape na yâ ti fini ti ala nga ala zia bê ti ala kue na Jéhovah.	In contrast, the Bible places a high value on loyalty that is motivated by love and kindness.	553	2. How can we exhibit “all mildness toward all men”?	655
Lo sû na mbeti: “I dabe i na lâ ti giriri, lâ ni so tongana i hinga lege ti Nzapa awe, i gbu ngangu na yâ kota tiri ti pono mingi.”	What does the book of Daniel teach us about the God we worship?	995	Hence, how grieved Jesus must have been to see an ambitious attitude continue among the disciples he had trained!	859
So a yeke ngbanga ti e ti fa so e ye Jéhovah biani, e yeke bâ ni tongana nyen?	“As is the case with all the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses, religious funding is handled on a voluntary basis, each one personally determining the amount and frequency of his religious ‘donations.’”​—European Court of Human Rights, 2011	616	[Credit Line]	452
Ti wa tere ayeke ti fa na mba atënë so agbu bê	They also defame God.	62	(Deuteronomy 11:8) At Leviticus 20:22, 24, that same land is mentioned: “You people must keep all my statutes and all my judicial decisions and do them, that the land to which I am bringing you to dwell in it may not vomit you out.	389

L’heure ahon asi na bê ti bï.	Apostate leaders were a trap and a net for the Israelites, enticing them to practice idolatry.	61	(Isaiah 11:9) At that time, all mankind will learn Jehovah God’s ways and imitate his loving personality.	520
Jésus adë nga bê ti ala so Nzapa ayeke bata ala tongana ala zia bê ti ala na lo ti mû maboko na ala nga ti mû ngangu na ala (Luc 12:4-12).	God’s promises have never failed, and they never will. (Isaiah 55:10, 11) Would you like to see this change?	40	(Ex. 34:5-7) Moreover, from Jesus’ glorified position in heaven, he continues to help his disciples to make known Jehovah’s name throughout the earth.	791
Ambeni ayeke ândö azo so asara poroso, akota zo ti abungbi ti nzapa wala azo so aye ti ga kota zo na yâ ti dunia so.

Ngangu ti aturugu ti sengo kando so azia mbito pëpe na bê ti azo so ayeke na yâ ti agbagba so angoro gbata ni.	However, the Bible does not portray the garden that way.	268	5 Many faithful servants of Jehovah have had to contend with health problems.	233
5 Nyen la azo so aye andia ti Nzapa alingbi ti sara ti tene asabango ti Satan so amû ndo laso abuba li ti ala ape?

Bungbi ti aita-koli na aita-wali so amû maboko na azo ti kobela nga na ambakoro	At the same time, they avoid imputing wrong motives to their brothers and are not overhasty to view them as apostates.	990	That Law is not binding upon Christians, yet it served as “a shadow of the good things to come.”	736
17 Simone abâ awe ngangu so Bible ayeke na ni ti mû maboko na zo.	In each of them, of course, the conscience will come into play, but it needs to be guided, first and foremost, by the Bible’s inspired standards of conduct.	64	With that schedule, I started regular pioneering.	46
Lo pensé ti lo so peut-être guengo na ndo ni kâ la ayeke sara si lo wu bê ti lo na tënë ti mara ni.	However, we should not conclude that Jehovah is insensitive to any suffering that his servants may experience in the meantime.	366	Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing?”	126
A yeke ngangu wa, nga ngbanga ti nyen a yeke nzoni e zia si a fa lege na e? Nyen la e lingbi ti sara ti bâ nzoni na lege ni?	(Psalm 105:4) Why?	714	Such fear and anxiety, plus numerous personal conflicts and disappointments, have made our times precisely what the apostle Paul described: “Know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.	72
Ngbanga ti nyen? 9 Nduru lege so azo ti Israël alingbi fade ti mû ni ayeke lege so ayeke na tere ti Ngu ti Méditerranée, na so ahon na yâ ti sese ti Philistie.	“The Philosophy and Empty Deception” of the World	680	Why should we seek Jehovah’s direction before making decisions, and how can we do so?	962
Hôtel ni ayeke na milieu ti gbata ni nga ambeni zo so e yeke manda Bible na ala aye ti manda Bible ni na hôtel ni.	The rejection of God’s authority has caused untold suffering.	650	(Mark 8:34; John 3:3; 6:53; 17:14, 16) The proud, the rich, and the hypocritical viewed these requirements as too difficult to fulfill.	965
Bible afa nga polele so tongana mbeni zo, atâa lo yeke maseka wala mbakoro, ake ndara so alondo na Nzapa ngbanga ti so lo bâ ye na nene ni pëpe wala lo sala kpengba-li, lo yeke wara ye ti sioni mingi na pekoni (aProverbe 13:18).	(Genesis 1:28; Acts 17:26) Adam was the first of a new form of earthly life, able to know God and to serve him faithfully.	469	We, though, should be like Joshua in our resoluteness to resist pressures toward illegal or immoral acts.	512
YE SO BIBLE AFA: Bible afa so zingongo ti Jésus na kuâ ayeke tâ nde na ti azo miombe so a sara tënë ti ala na yâ ti Mbeti ti Nzapa.	For example, people who did not support Communism had been treated as second-rate citizens.	748	Some experts have even felt that translation is beyond what a computer can do.	753

About 55 C.E., an appeal went out to Gentile Christians in Europe and Asia Minor in behalf of the impoverished congregation in Judea.	750	(1 Corinthians 7:23) True, none of us like to be unpopular, but we must bear in mind that Christians have standards that are different from those in the world.	286
Ngangu so ndoye, ndara, na mbilimbili akanga ndo ni pepe ayeke sioni.	As we use our Christian publications, we must be careful not to skip the Bible references.	792	The next conquest is the royal city of Ai.	879
(Marc 10:14) Na pekoni, lo sala mbeni ye so afa na gigi tâ kode ti salango ye yeke nga na ndoye.	The Bible foretold that wicked conduct would prevail in “the last days.”	2	The need to keep our faith healthy can be likened to a plant’s need for water.	951
Lo tene: ‘I bâ apakpo; ala lu le-kobe pëpe, na ala fâ le-kobe pëpe, na ala yeke na magasin wala gogoro pëpe; me Nzapa amû kobe na ala.	What is the Golden Rule, and how is it of practical value in a marriage?	595	Wherever they live, Christians seek to exercise practical wisdom in dealing with local situations, remembering that what is acceptable and legal in one land may be totally unacceptable and illegal in another.	270
Na pekoni, Nzapa atene na lo so a yeke zi “kî” so na lege ti mbeni miracle pëpe.	(Matthew 4:4; John 4:34) If you talk about emotional wounds each time you open the Bible, you could cause your mate to lose his or her spiritual appetite.	335	(Read Zechariah 6:9-12.)	550
Lo sû mbeti na aChrétien so ayeke na Rome, lo tene: “Mbi yeke na nzara mingi ti bâ ala, si mbi mû na ala mbeni matabisi ti yingo ti tene asara si ala kpengba, wala ti tene e wa terê na popo ti e, na lege ti mabe ti mba, mabe ti ala na ti mbi nga.” (aRom.	(2 Ki. 5:11) And if the counsel touches a particularly sensitive area​—the actions of a family member, our dress and grooming, our personal hygiene, or a form of recreation that we enjoy but that Jehovah hates—​we might react quite negatively, to our own surprise and to our counselor’s dismay!	499	This provides more opportunities for “an interchange of encouragement.”	208
Mbi sambela, mbi tene: “Jéhovah, mû maboko na mbi ti sara si koli so amû mbage ti mbi.”	Such scriptures as Isaiah 54:4 and 1 Corinthians 7:15 gave me peace of mind and the strength to go on with life.	465	Emil was sent to a labor camp and met the Witnesses there.	455
I ndoye aïta.”​—1 PIERRE 2:17.	Why is Satan likened to a birdcatcher?	377	What can the ransom do for us?	546
Tongaso, zia e gi lege kue ti sara kusala nzoni na épée ti yingo na yâ ti kusala ti fango tënë ti Royaume so Nzapa amû na e.	He told them: “I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.”​—Acts 20:29, 30.	711	Of course, there are other characteristics that identify a truly spiritual person, but how do you measure up to those already considered?	511
Ye ti peko ni ayeke so, gunda ti ngongoa ti tënë ti Royaume ni asigi na amaï ti ga tongana mbeni keke ti blé so tongana ngoi ayeke hon a yeke nduru ti lë lengo.	It is fitting, then, that God should use a special expression of his authority to end human suffering and accomplish his original purpose for the earth.	284	He admonished his listeners: “Never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing.	649
NGBÂ TI DUTI NA KPENGBA MABE	IT WAS early Sunday morning, about nine o’clock.	767	By standing quietly while others salute the flag, true Christians make it evident that they are respectful observers.	120
Lo tene: “Mbi gi ti zia bê ti mbi kue na Jéhovah.	Do not rely on your own strength or ability alone.	527	But if I became a Witness today, by tomorrow everyone would know about it.	154
Ahon kue, fango nzo tënë ayeke sara si azo agonda iri ti Jéhovah na ndo ti sese kue (Ps. 113:3).	Hence, how grieved Jesus must have been to see an ambitious attitude continue among the disciples he had trained!	412	Let us consider these three forms of comfort, one at a time.	356
8 Akoli kue so e sara tënë na ndo ti ala ayeke na yâ ti sewa so akpengba na lege ti yingo nga ala yeke na pasa ti sara ye so ayeke na lege ni.

5 Na salango tënë ti songo so abungbi e na Jéhovah, Jésus atene: “A lingbi mo ndoye Seigneur Nzapa ti mo na bê ti mo kue, na âme ti mo kue, na bibe ti mo kue.”	(Matt. 24:37) For example, we also witness interference by wicked spirits.	813	WHO would not love to live in a society where war was “incomprehensible and repulsive”?	213
Lo zonga lani Nzapa pëpe tongana ti so Satan atene lani so lo yeke sara ni (Job 1:11, 21).	Jehovah unfailingly carries out his purposes.	648	On March 24, 1988, I was moved from the high-security camp to a nearby settlement camp.	876
Mara ti nzara ti ye tongaso alingbi na nda ni ti buba fini ti mbeni Chrétien na ti kanga ndo ti tënë ni si “a lë pëpe.”	What a record of faith and courage​—all of it proof of God-given strength!	77	Just let your word Yes mean Yes, your No, No; for what is in excess of these is from the wicked one.”​—Matt. 5:34, 37. Jehovah’s promises always come true	28

Knowing that his time is short, the Devil vents his wrath upon anointed Christians and their companions.	275	Bezalel and Oholiab must have learned well, for they not only performed their duties but also taught others what to do.	610

Tongana fade Adam na Ève akui sân ti dü molenge, ka ye so Nzapa aleke na bê ti lo ti tene ahale ti ala amû ndö ti sese kue ayeke ga tâ tënë pëpe.	What happens when Jesus goes to the temple?	145	This simile may mean that they had been like a bullock that would never have “felt the goad if he had not first rebelled against the yoke,” says one reference work.	519
A yeda na demande ti mbi ti sara kua na Béthel na mbi gue na Béthel ti Brooklyn na nze ti août, ngu 1954.	‘If God really cared,’ they reason, ‘surely he would prevent such tragic things from happening.’	501	Thus, we can have confidence in Jesus’ leadership as well.	299
6 Bible atene: “L’Éternel asara tënë na Moïse, Lo tene, Mo sara tënë na bungbi ti azo ni, mo tene, londo, i zia tere ti tente ti Koré, Dathan, na Abiram.
