The most effective way of preventing STIs is by not having sex.[4] Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV.[4] Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller number of sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk.[1][4] Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections.[1] Most STIs are treatable or curable.[1] Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable.[1] Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.[5] 	I wish you a Merry Christmas.	74	139	False	0.009194374
