Right now the `mc160.dev.english.txt` is copied directly from Github, but there are actually some errors in this, which have been fixed for the Mauritian translation. 


WE MUST FIX THE ENGLISH DOT DEV FILE!!!!
Error: Mc160.dev.17 story
In this story, question 3, the correct answer is B, but the text incorrectly says "pink" flowers, instead of "yellow" flowers. The Mauritian translation has been fixed to say "yellow" flowers
