Hva var det for noe?!"" ""Ryk og reis, Deres Majestet!"" Ropte Fari av full hals. ""Du verden... Du har mensen som vanlig, ser jeg,"" fortsatte kongen å mumle nedslått. ""Helvete som jeg kjeder meg.

""Jeg lurer meg på hva malt kanel smaker,"" sa han likeglad idet han stappet skjea i munnen."	"Three hours later, the King was loitering around the castle, looking for something to busy himself with. ""Fuck, I'm so bored,"" he grumbled in exasperation. ""The kids are at school. Gwo's at work. Impa's at the hospital.

""My... PMSing as usual, I see,"" the King continued to mutter dejectedly. ""Shit, I'm so fucking bored. Nothing good on TV. Nothing good online. Nothing good to eat."" As he was about to leave the dining hall, his eyes were drawn to a cinnamon jar standing lonely on the table. A spoon of cinnamon was placed conveniently next to it. In a saner state the King may have been reasonably suspicious about it, but now he was so exhausted from boredom that any opportunity to relieve it for a minute felt like a blessing.
