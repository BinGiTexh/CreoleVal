Hva var det for noe?!"" ""Ryk og reis, Deres Majestet!"" Ropte Fari av full hals. ""Du verden... Du har mensen som vanlig, ser jeg,"" fortsatte kongen å mumle nedslått. ""Helvete som jeg kjeder meg. Ingenting verdt å se på på TV. Ingenting kjekt på nett. Ingenting godt å spise."" Idet han var i ferd med å forlate spisesalen, ble oppmerksomheten tatt opp av en ensom krukke kanel på bordet. En skje fylt med kanel var beleilig satt ned ved siden av den. Hadde kongen da vært mer tilregnelig, hadde han nok vært noenlunde mistenksom, men da han var så utmattet av kjedsomhet at enhver mulighet å slukke den om bare i et minutt føltes ut som en velsignelse. ""Jeg lurer meg på hva malt kanel smaker,"" sa han likeglad idet han stappet skjea i munnen."	"Three hours later, the King was loitering around the castle, looking for something to busy himself with. ""Fuck, I'm so bored,"" he grumbled in exasperation. ""The kids are at school. Gwo's at work. Impa's at the hospital.

""My... PMSing as usual, I see,"" the King continued to mutter dejectedly. ""Shit, I'm so fucking bored. Nothing good on TV. Nothing good online. Nothing good to eat."" As he was about to leave the dining hall, his eyes were drawn to a cinnamon jar standing lonely on the table. A spoon of cinnamon was placed conveniently next to it. In a saner state the King may have been reasonably suspicious about it, but now he was so exhausted from boredom that any opportunity to relieve it for a minute felt like a blessing. ""I wonder what ground cinnamon tastes like,"" said he nonchalantly and put the spoon in his mouth."
