E selebrashon aki lo sigui te ora Hesus bini pa risibí su siguidónan ungí den shelu pa medio di un resurekshon pa bida spiritual durante su “binida,” òf presensia. (1 Tesalonisensenan 4:14-17) Esaki ta na armonia ku loke Kristu a bisa e 11 apòstelnan leal: “Ora mi bai i prepará un lugá pa boso, lo mi bin atrobe i risibí boso serka mi, pa kaminda ami ta, boso tambe por ta.”—Juan 14:3.	14 Kristina asked Jehovah for help to make spiritual advancement.	292	This observance would continue until Jesus’ arrival to receive his anointed followers into heaven by a resurrection to spirit life during his “presence.” (1 Thessalonians 4:14-17) This harmonizes with Christ’s words to the 11 loyal apostles: “If I go my way and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you home to myself, that where I am you also may be.”​—John 14:3.	820
Aunke 44 porciento di mucha moslim a asistí na servicionan religioso tur siman, “ta nan tambe a registrá e cantidad mas grandi di esnan cu no a asistí (39%) durante e aña promé cu e encuesta.”	(Joel 2:30-32) Those of us who will make up the “great crowd” of survivors into God’s new world and who remain faithful during a final test will be ‘satisfied by him with length of days’​—life without end.	298	While 44 percent of Muslim children attended Islamic religious services each week, “they also recorded the highest rate of nonattendance (39%) during the year preceding the survey.”	391

(Amos 1:1; 7:14) In the days of Elijah the prophet, when a famine came upon Israel, Elijah had to depend on the hospitality of a poor widow, whose meager supply of flour and oil were miraculously sustained during the famine.	67	Humility will enable you to face up to difficult circumstances and to endure, even as Job did.	8
El a bira asina bon conocí, cu hopi bes hende ta referí na dje como e Regla di Oro.	The apostle Peter wrote: “According to their wish, this fact escapes their notice,” namely that God brought a deluge upon the world of Noah’s time.	449	So well-known has it become that it is often referred to as the Golden Rule.	80
Maske “nos hende eksterior ta degenerá,” nos no ta entregá pasobra “nos hende interior ta wòrdu renobá dia pa dia.”—2 Korintionan 4:16.

Den otro obranan, Hesus ta parse un hende sobrehumano, ku un krans di lus riba su kabes òf un hende ku ta tene otro hende leu for di dje.	God’s will is that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Timothy 2:4) If God loved mankind so much that he sent his Son to earth to die for us, we have no reason to feel that we are unloved or worthless.	527	In other presentations, Jesus appears supernatural, adorned with a halo, or distant from those around him.	579

(Proverbs 22:6) Young Fernando says: “I’m a neat person, and my roommate was sloppy.	434	(Acts 17:26) Just as older people should avoid making critical comparisons between the youth of yesteryear and those of today, so young people abroad should avoid making critical comparisons between a foreign country and their own.	680

We were divided into small groups and immediately dispersed throughout the area.	556	(Hebrews 4:13) The strongest incentive for maintaining marital fidelity, then, is the realization that no matter how secret an infidelity might be and how minor its physical or social consequences might seem, any act of sexual uncleanness damages our relationship with Jehovah.	682
