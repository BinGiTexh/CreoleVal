Me ti bâ ni nzoni, atâa ndara na hingango ye so azo ayeke na ni, ala lingbi pëpe ti mû mbeni ndia tongaso (Jérémie 10:23; aRomain 3:10, 23).	The need to extend hospitality still exists.	128	Obviously, no law or standard proposed by any human, no matter how intelligent or sincere, can meet that need.

He might have thought it safest to avoid meat sold in a meat market, much as another would shun meat if there was a chance that it was once offered to an idol.	92
Tara ti gbu li gi na ndo gbâ ti atënë so lo lingbi fade ti sala na kusala teti so hingango ye ti lo akono lani mingi.

A lingbi ti mû maboko na mo tongana nyen ti bâ wala mo yeke sara jeux na azo so mo hinga ala ape na ndö ti Internet?	17, 18. (a) As to our race for life, what can we learn from the “cloud of witnesses”? (b) What will be considered in the following article?	658	Or what should you do if invited to play online games with strangers?	614
Tongana Bible afa ndia polele na ndo ti mbeni ye ape, tongana nyen la e lingbi ti soro aye so ayeke nzere na Jéhovah?	Lovingly, God provided “long garments of skin” to replace the loin coverings of fig leaves that they had sewn together for themselves. (Genesis 3:7, 21) Rather than leave them in their shame, God treated them with dignity.	191	In the absence of specific laws, how can we know what choices will please Jehovah?	9
[Foto na lembeti 18]	The judges of the Sanhedrin were determined to have them put to death. (Acts 5:33) However, events took an unexpected turn.	37	[Picture on page 18]	125
Ye oko, Bible afa yaka ti Éden tongaso pëpe.	These unions were unnatural, and they produced hybrid offspring known as Nephilim.	186	However, the Bible does not portray the garden that way.	666
Paul atene: “E ye ti sara ye mbilimbili na yâ ti aye kue.” (aHéb.	However, your parents make rules primarily because they are concerned about you.	713	Paul said: “We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.”	943
‘JÉSUS ti Nazareth akomande e ti fa tënë na azo, na ti sala tënë ti témoin, so Lo yeke Zo so Nzapa ahiri Lo na gigi ti ga Juge ti azo so ayeke na fini na ti awakinda.’	Wherever they live, Christians seek to exercise practical wisdom in dealing with local situations, remembering that what is acceptable and legal in one land may be totally unacceptable and illegal in another.	850	“JESUS who was from Nazareth . . . ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the One decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.”	219
3 Jésus ahinga lani so afango ye ti lo ayeke kangbi yâ ti azo nga so a lingbi azo so amû peko ti lo asara ye na mbeto ape na ngoi so ala wara kangango lege.	(Ex. 3:2, 7, 8, 10) Back in Egypt, Moses, ‘the meekest of all men,’ needed faith and courage to appear before Pharaoh.	510	3 Jesus knew that his teachings would divide people and that those who follow him would need courage to do so in the face of opposition.	323
E yeke na bezoin ti fa na gigi lakue so e zia bê ti e kue na Jéhovah, me na hingango ye ti e mveni pëpe (aProverbe 3:5).	Similarly, when someone began to help us to understand the Scriptures, we had our first glimpse of “the deep things of God.”​—1 Corinthians 2:8-10.	440	(Proverbs 3:5) In that way, we will keep “a firm hold on the real life”​—eternal life in God’s new world.​—1 Timothy 6:12, 19.	236
So Marie nga na ambeni wali ayeke na popo ti azo so a tuku yingo vulu ti Nzapa na ndo ti ala afa so a soro lo nga na awali so ti komande na yâ ti Royaume ti Jésus na yayu.	14 The fifth head of the wild beast of Revelation represents Greece.	397	That Mary was among those blessed in this way shows that she and the other women who received the holy spirit were chosen to be a part of Jesus’ heavenly Kingdom.	900
Na tapande, amaseka saki mingi so alondo ti hunzi mandango mbeti ti ala akono yâ ti kusala ti ala na fadeso ala wara ngia ti sara kusala ti pionnier na bê ti ala kue.	In fact, Jesus said: “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.”	685	(Matt. 9:37, 38) For instance, many thousands of our young people who recently graduated from school have expanded their ministry and are now experiencing the joy that comes from zealously serving as pioneers.	968
Teti so lo hinga a ngbâ na lo ngoi mingi pepe, Diable ayeke na kota ngonzo na ndo aChrétien so asa yingo na ndo ti ala nga na ndo afon ala.	When reading Jesus’ illustrations, ask the following questions:	165	Knowing that his time is short, the Devil vents his wrath upon anointed Christians and their companions.	869
Bango ndo wa la a lingbi amaseka ake ni? Ngbanga ti nyen?	Tim: So, then, why do people say that you don’t believe in Jesus?	307	What tendency do young people need to resist, and why?	87
Rebecca so ayeke na ngu 12, a tene: “Pardon, ala ngbâ ti sigigi na fini Tour ti Ba Ndo so!”	I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week.	174	Twelve-year-old Rebecca requested: “Please keep the new edition going!”	565
Ti tâ tënë ni, mo lingbi pëpe ti mä go ti Jésus laso, me na yâ ti Bible mo lingbi ti diko ye na ndo ti aye so lo tene nga na aye so lo sara.	These people too need to learn about Jehovah.	409	Of course, you cannot hear the voice of Jesus today, but you can read about what he said and did, as revealed in the Scriptures.	605
Atënë so kue ayeke gboto nga lê na ndo nzoye ti Jéhovah so asi singo nga na nzobe ti lo so lo leke aye teti salut ti azo.	They exclaimed: “See! The world has gone after him.”​—John 12:19.	478	All of this also highlights Jehovah’s abundant goodness and undeserved kindness in making provision for mankind’s salvation.	2
Ngbanga ti nyen a lingbi e gbu nda ti kusala so Jésus ayeke sara tongana “Kota Mokonzi ti mabe ti e na Lo so asara si mabe ti e alingbi kue”?	That sign would mark “the conclusion of the system of things” and lead to the time when “the end will come.”	390	Why is it essential that we understand Jesus’ role as “the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith”?	799
Mbeni zo alingbi na bê kue ti tene so Satan asö benda na ndo kota tënë so a bâ gigi, so andu lege ti komande?	Can You Control Your Destiny?	822	No, for the prophet Jeremiah accurately declared: “I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong.	985
Kota ndoye na bingo bê ti lo na ndo zo asala si “lâ ti Lo asu na ndo azo ti sioni na azo ti nzoni, na Lo sala si ngu apika na ndo azo ti mbilimbili na azo ti kirikiri”.	21 Those who enter the full-time ministry do so, not to gain financially, but to give​—to Jehovah and to others.	635	So loving and caring is he that “he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.”	3
• Ye ti nzoni wa e lingbi ti wara na mandango ye na ndo sewa ti Saphan?	Imagine, then, how you would feel if you learned that you had been lied to about God.	348	• How can we benefit from learning about the family of Shaphan?	889
Tongaso, a yeke na lege ni ti tene Nzapa amû komandema ti lo ti leke mbeni ye so ayeke nde ti hunzi na pasi ti azo na ti sala ye so lo leke giriri na bê ti lo ti sala teti sese.	The Romans considered Judaea to be such a place.	10	It is fitting, then, that God should use a special expression of his authority to end human suffering and accomplish his original purpose for the earth.	856
Pepe so a suru awe, fade Lo fâ pëpe; na mèche so kete wâ ayeke dä, fade Lo mingo pëpe, juska Lo sala si fango ngbanga ahon na ngangu.	Jehovah asks us the questions we read at Job 38:33-38.	786	He will not wrangle, nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways.	185
Mosoro ti lo ni alingbi ti hon hio tongana ti so aga. Ni la pëpe?	(1 Corinthians 7:23) True, none of us like to be unpopular, but we must bear in mind that Christians have standards that are different from those in the world.	847	Are not his riches likely to disappear as quickly as he acquired them?	518
(Ex. 15:13). Na pekoni, a yeke wara na “ndo ti duti” so temple, asacrificateur ni nga Jérusalem so ayeke li-kodoro ni.	(Romans 2:28, 29) But what comfort anointed ones can draw from Christ’s next words! He says: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer.	313	(Ex. 15:13) Later, that “abiding place” contained a temple with its priesthood and a capital city, Jerusalem, with a line of kings who descended from David and sat on Jehovah’s throne.	909
Na yâ ambilimbili lege wa e lingbi ti fa so e hinga biani ti kiri singila?	How can you know for sure?	606	In what practical ways can we demonstrate that we are truly thankful?	298
Ti tâ tënë ni, e ye ti son bê ti ala ape, me mingi ni, a yeke nzoni ti sara tënë na ala na nzoni bê nga polele.	(Ecclesiastes 7:12) With enough money, we can obtain food and a comfortable home.	19	(1 Pet. 4:3, 4) Of course, we try to avoid offending them, but it is usually best to speak with them in a kind, though straightforward, way.	552
Lo fa na mbi na lege ti Bible ti lo so Nzapa asala pasi na zo pëpe.	Jehovah blessed the first ten years of Asa’s reign with complete peace.	537	Using her Bible, she showed me that God does not make people suffer.	829
A-Proverbe 3:11, 12 atene: “Molenge ti mbi, tongana Jéhovah agi ti fa lege na mo, mo ke pëpe . . . ndali ti so azo so Jéhovah aye ala, lo suku na ala.”	In 1978, when Maria was 45, she again became pregnant.	428	“My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah, . . . for those whom Jehovah loves he reproves,” says Proverbs 3:11, 12.	705
Mbi yeke manda ye lani hio mingi, a sara si mbi yeke kpe na moto ka hio mingi, me mbi lingbi ti wara sioni dä.	But he did more.	158	I was a quick learner and soon became very successful in this fast and dangerous sport.	39
Ngoi na ngoi, na tapande ti molenge so agirisa, ambeni molenge alingbi ti dö lege ti tâ tënë azia.	And Jehovah really helped me.	565	At times, some young ones, like the prodigal son, may turn away from the truth.	660
Mû mbeni tapande ti fa kangbi so ayeke na popo ti hingango ye, gbungo nda ti ye nga na ndara.	“More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.”​—PROVERBS 4:23.	252	Illustrate the difference between knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.	311
E yeke manda tongana nyen la e lingbi ti fa nzoni tënë nga tongana nyen la e lingbi ti mû maboko nzoni na azo ti mä yâ ti tâ tënë ti Bible.—Mat. 28:19, 20.	Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.	96	We learn how to preach the good news and how to teach Scriptural principles effectively.​—Matt. 28:19, 20.	982
Ambage ti mbeti so a rulê ni rulengo so a fa ni ge ayeke gi ambeni mbage ti Septante ti yanga ti Grec so a sû ni na ngoi ti akozo Chrétien. Na yâ ni a yeke bâ polele iri ti Jéhovah so a sû ni na agere-mbeti osio ti Hébreu יהוה (YHWH).	This can be seen from Daniel’s prophecy involving Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about the chopping down of an immense tree.	893	The fragments illustrated here are portions of the Greek Septuagint that date from the first century B.C.E. They clearly show Jehovah’s name, represented in the Greek text by the four Hebrew letters יהוה (YHWH), or the Tetragrammaton.	902
• Foto ti adoli tongana a bâ ndo na mbage ti porte a ga na pasa	One idea that Nathan in particular believed in was that of establishing a school for missionaries.	684	• A picture of elephants brings good luck if it faces a door	510

Ye nyen mo leke na bê ti mo ti sala, na mo lingbi ti zia bê ti mo na ndo nyen?	Thus, we can have confidence in Jesus’ leadership as well.	873	What are you determined to do, and in what can you have confidence?	987
Ndali ti asiokpari so azo ti Israël asara na yando, ala lingbi na kuâ.	6 As we look back now, we might well ask ourselves: ‘Am I making progress in my friendship with God?	180	For these, they rightly deserved to be left alone to die.	400
Tongana Nzapa Babâ ti ala ayeda pëpe, mbeni ndeke oko alingbi ti tï na sese pëpe.	(Daniel 7:13, 14) Two years later, Daniel has a vision that involves Medo-Persia, Greece, and an entity that becomes “a king fierce in countenance.”​—Daniel 8:23.	667	Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge.	109
Na pekoni, e wara mbeni kete da ti lango.	By the time we left that assignment, a flourishing congregation was established there.	897	Despite the inconveniences, we were really blessed.	695
14 Tongana nyen si e yeke fa so e yeke be-ta-zo na yâ kusala so a mû na e ti sala?	Still, before accepting the youth as his son, the man wants the boy to make a promise.	761	14 How do we show faithfulness in the ministry that is entrusted to us?	502
Yingo ti Nzapa asara kusala na ndo ti ala na alege wa?	2 As a youth, you can make choices that may later open up enjoyable opportunities for you in God’s service.	992	In what ways did God’s spirit operate upon them?	947
2 GBU LI TI MO: Teti so ambeni zo ayeke na ngoi mingi pëpe, ala yeke diko Mbeti ti Nzapa gi tongaso.	We saw steady increases in publishers and congregations in the circuits we served.	502	2 MEDITATE: Because of lack of time, some limit themselves to a superficial reading of God’s Word.	329

Tongana ambeni zo ayeke sara tënë ti amolenge ti ala, mbi mene ngu ti yanga ti mbi gbä na a lingbi mbi kanga bê ti mbi si ngu ti lê ti mbi ayuru pëpe.”	In fact, by the early 1990’s, more than a hundred of their descendants were Witnesses of Jehovah​—all the result of one man’s discovering a single tract on a railroad track!	964	When others speak of their sons, my throat tightens up and I have to hold back tears.”	702
15 Moïse ayeke tâ lani na bezoin ti pusu Jéhovah ti changé bibe ti lo?	Thus, while man has dominion over animals, he should not abuse that authority but use it in harmony with the principles of God’s Word.	675	15 Did Moses really need to correct Jehovah’s thinking?	801
Azo ayeke wara liberté na lege ti yingo tongana ala mû mbage ti “tâ tënë” na yengo dä na kusala ti Jésus na yâ ye so Nzapa aleke ti sala (Jean 8:32-36; 18:37).	The Bible says that Almighty God shows favor to humble individuals “in due time.” (1 Peter 5:6) So if there seems to be a delay in his answering our sincere requests, we need not see this as a lack of interest on Jehovah’s part.	815	(John 8:32-36; 18:37) Because sheeplike ones accept the truth and follow Christ in faith, they will receive everlasting life.​—John 10:24-28.	59
SARA YE NA MBETO PËPE TONGANA TI JÉSUS	Illustrate the difference between knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.	294	IMITATE JESUS’ COURAGE	543
Bible afa na mbeni lege so ayeke pendere mingi aye ti nzoni so azo ayeke wara ande na gbe ti Royaume.	For example, in order to visit a small group of Witnesses who met on a farm in Mato Grosso State, I had to cross the Araguaia River by boat and ride about 15 miles [25 km] through the forest.	328	The Bible eloquently describes the blessings the people will enjoy under the Kingdom.	786
Me aChrétien so a sa yingo na ndo ti ala alingbi ti wara tâ dengo bê biani na lege ti atënë so Christ atene na pekoni.	Recall what the prophet Elisha told King Jehoash, who had come to Elisha for help to fight against Syrian invaders.	28	(Romans 2:28, 29) But what comfort anointed ones can draw from Christ’s next words! He says: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer.	287
(Kusala 2:17, 18; Joël 2:28).	It includes the Governing Body, branch committees, traveling overseers, bodies of elders, congregations, and individual Witnesses.​—4/15, page 29.	900	(Acts 2:17, 18; Joel 2:28) Accordingly, in these last days, Jehovah has used elderly members of the anointed class and of the “other sheep” to declare his purposes.	526
Ita Rutherford ahunda ti tene e leke ti sara akota bungbi na yâ ti agbata mingi na do ti États-Unis nga ti tokua awamungo diskur ti sara kue ti kpengba aita.”	Some people think that religion is only for older folks.	745	Brother Rutherford requested that we arrange conventions in several cities in the western United States and send speakers to try to encourage the friends as much as possible.”	364
Ala ye ti hinga wala eskê mbi hinga so desizion so mbi mû so ayeke biani kota ye na lê ti mbi.	Concerning that coming judgment, the apostle Paul wrote that the Lord Jesus, accompanied by “his powerful angels,” will bring “vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thess. 1:7, 8) Notice that people will be judged on the basis of their response to the good news.	762	They wanted to make sure I knew how serious my decision was.	625
Lo hunda na mbi ti gi mbeni zo so asala nzara ti tâ tënë, so fadeso lo yeke na yâ ti kando so mbi yeke dä.	But where widows are in need, family members ought to help.	721	Writing such an open letter was unwise, for our letters were censored.	647
Legeoko nga, tongana e bâ lege so a leke na ndagigi nga na gbâ ti akobe so a zia na “ndo ti batango kobe” ti sese (so ayeke ye so asi), fade a yeke duti na lege ni ti yeda so mbeni zo (so ayeke na gunda ti ye ni) si asala ye so kue. A yeke tongaso pëpe?’	Regarding the anointed, for what are we grateful, and what can we confidently believe?	51	The Bible’s simple argument puts it best: “Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but he that constructed all things is God.”	551
Tongana Tertullien aglisa lege na lo gi ti fa dutingo ti Jésus tongana nzapa na lege ti mbeni tënë nde, lo sigigi na mbeni tënë “ye oko so azo ota ayeke na yâ ni.”	When she was found murdered, I must admit that I initially wondered why my prayers were not answered.	81	Using this concept, he attempted to show that God, his Son, and the holy spirit were three distinct persons existing in one divine substance.	222
Biani, a yeke gi na tenengo na yanga so e yeke ti Christ la anzere na Jéhovah pëpe, me a yeke ti sara ye so a hunda na aChrétien ti sara. Ti atâ disciple ti Christ, ye so andu fini ti ala kue, bango ndo ti ala na ndo ti nginza, kua ti mitele, angia, angobo na amatanga ti dunia so, a ndu nga mariage na songo so ala yeke na ni na amba ti ala.	For example, what principles might we discern in the arrangement of cities of refuge?	480	For Christ’s true followers, that involves their whole way of life, including their attitude toward money, secular work, entertainment, worldly customs and celebrations, and marriage and other relationships with fellow humans.	750
Aprophétie ni so aga tâ tënë tâ na gbe ti lê ti mbi.	Bearing that out, before sending his disciples out into the ministry, Jesus Christ told them: “When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.”	490	Those prophecies were being fulfilled in front of my eyes.	194
Satan ayeke nga lani dä, na lo bi atënë na li ti Job.	8 Hebrews 13:4 and 1 Corinthians 6:9 establish that God disapproves of both adultery and fornication (Greek, por·neiʹa).	342	Satan was also present, and he leveled charges against Job.	716
A yeke tongana lê ti moutarde; tongana a lu lê ni so na sese, lê ni so ayeke kete mingi na popo ti le-kasa kue so ayeke na ndo sese, me tongana a lu lê ni so na sese, a maï, na a ga kota ahon mbeni kasa kue, na a sara tikeke ni kota, si andeke ti nduzu alingbi duti na gbede ni.”​—Marc 4:30-32.	3 Jesus knew that his teachings would divide people and that those who follow him would need courage to do so in the face of opposition.	271	Like a mustard grain, which at the time it was sown in the ground was the tiniest of all the seeds that are on the earth​—but when it has been sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all other vegetables and produces great branches, so that the birds of the heaven are able to find lodging under its shadow.”​—Mark 4:30-32.	138
Azo ti yingo ayeke sara kue ti “ga azo so asara ye tongana ti Nzapa”. (aÉph.	“Despite the difficult conditions, we were spiritually awake.	241	Spiritually-minded individuals strive to “become imitators of God.”	680

Mbi ye si azo azia mbi ti mû adesizion mbi wani na ala bâ na nene ni adesizion ti mbi.	9 What lesson can we learn from the “seal” in Paul’s word picture?	949	I like for people to let me decide​—and then respect my decisions.	506

They took them to the north and the east.	112	For example, in order to visit a small group of Witnesses who met on a farm in Mato Grosso State, I had to cross the Araguaia River by boat and ride about 15 miles [25 km] through the forest.	312
(Psaume 11:5, Mbeti ti Nzapa, Tënë so amû fini).	2 MEDITATE: Because of lack of time, some limit themselves to a superficial reading of God’s Word.	305	(Psalm 11:5) The Creator loves peace and justice.	880

You can rightly view them as such because all individuals who hope in them will be sorely disappointed.​—Read Isaiah 28:15, 17.	894	7 What will help us to resist such negative thinking and thereby maintain a sense of urgency?	140
Atapande use so afa biani so Jéhovah Nzapa ayeke “yä iri ti zo teti lê ti lo pëpe”.​—Deut. 10:17.	[Picture on page 4]	198	How vividly these two examples show that Jehovah our God “treats none with partiality”!​—Deut. 10:17.	641
Ni la, lakue tongana ala yeke manda Bible si mo yeke fa gi ye so ason bê ti mo, mo lingbi ti zi nzara ti mandango Bible ni na bê ti koli wala wali ti mo.	18, 19. (a) How did Jehovah foretell that he would produce a new people for his name? (b) What will be examined in the following article?	164	(Matthew 4:4; John 4:34) If you talk about emotional wounds each time you open the Bible, you could cause your mate to lose his or her spiritual appetite.	851
Na ngoi ti matanga ti Noël, mingi ni a yeke leke na tele ti ada ti Mairie akota ndo so akpa da ti batango anyama na a zia na yâ ni astatue so akono alingbi na zo.

A yeke polele so aye mingi afa so Jéhovah andoye e.	Everyone alive serves some god or other. (Josh. 24:15) Why not take refuge in the only God worth serving?	828	Clearly, there is abundant proof that Jehovah loves us.	164
(Kusala 17:11).	5 Read Zechariah 5:3, 4.	357	(Acts 17:11) Like those readers, you may need to lift any veil of bias or criticism that might blur your understanding.	172
8 A-Hébreu 13:4 nga na 1 aCorinthien 6:9 afa polele so Nzapa ake tënë ti gingo koli wala wali na gigi ti mariage nga na pitan (Grec, por·neiʹa).

However, the original-language word for loving-kindness means more than kindness stemming from love.	378	The smallest letter of the Greek alphabet is iota and is evidently similar to the Hebrew י (yod).	607

Lo he bia lo tene: “A yeke nzoni na mbi ti ga nduru na Nzapa.	The answer goes back to the dawn of human history, when our first parents rebelled against God as Ruler.	569	He sang: “As for me, the drawing near to God is good for me.	377
Lo yeke sara nyen na nginza so lo wara so?	People like my soap and recommend it to others.	723	What would she do?	90
Ambele so nga kue ayeke ga ande gi “mvene”.	In addition, Satan’s rebellion has given Jehovah an opportunity to demonstrate His fine qualities in a more pronounced way.	932	Those alliances too will prove to be “a lie.”	821

What can we do to find true happiness and satisfaction?	196	I look forward to the day when all communication barriers will be removed and all will speak the “pure language”​—the truth about Jehovah God and his purposes—​as part of a united human family.​—Zephaniah 3:9.	70
7 Tongana ndia ti Nzapa ayeke biani na yâ ti bê ti mbeni koli na wali ti lo, a yeke sara si ala duti na aye tongana mabe, beku nga na ndoye, na a yeke mû maboko na ala ti kpengba songo ti ala (1 aCor.	Now, why would Paul​—a spiritual “giant” who likely was a member of the first-century governing body—​call himself a “miserable man”?	382	7 If God’s law is truly within our inward parts, such qualities as faith, hope, and love will be displayed and will help to nourish the marriage bond.	531
A ye ti tene so Nzapa aleke e ti tene e sara ye tongana ti lo, nga lo mû na e ndara ti hinga ti sara kangbi na popo ti nzoni na sioni.	Nobody else can do this for us.	516	He gave us the capacity to reflect his qualities and moral standards, his sense of right and wrong.	617
Ti zia bê kue na zendo ti Jéhovah ayeke mû maboko tongana nyen na mbeni zo ti sara ye alingbi na ndia so ayeke na Deutéronome 15:7, 8?	Let us consider these three forms of comfort, one at a time.	859	How would trusting in Jehovah’s promise have aided a person in obeying the law at Deuteronomy 15:7, 8?	942
5 Diko Zacharie 5:3, 4.	Later, I was invited to transfer to the Buxton Congregation, which had very few publishers and needed help.	875	5 Read Zechariah 5:3, 4.	341
(Jean 17:16).	I once heard a doctor say: “A disease does not destroy a person; rather, it changes him.”	561	(John 17:16) True Christians remain neutral in conflicts of the world; hence, they are able to enjoy unity even when those around them are at war.	487
Ti duti na oko bango ndo tongaso na ndo ti kuâ ti mbeni Chrétien so ayeke be-ta-zo alingbi ti sara si bê ti e adë kamême ndali ti so e hinga so a yeke zingo ande lo.​—Zo-ti-fa-tene 7:1.	For the things . . . unseen are everlasting.”—2 Corinthians 4:16-18.	524	Taking a similar view of the death of a faithful Christian may lessen our grief because we know that he is in line for a resurrection.​—Ecclesiastes 7:1.	927

The psalmist David, who was no stranger to adversity, wrote: “Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him, to all those who call upon him in trueness.	883	(Gal. 6:1; Heb. 12:11) Third, elders are commissioned and trained to reassure repentant sinners, helping to ease their pain and guilt.	448
Fade azendo ti Jéhovah ayeke ga tâ tënë	Through whom, though, would it operate?	151	Jehovah’s promises will come true	83
Ambeni ngoi ayeke dä so a yeke nzoni e kiri e gbu li na ndö ti mbeni desizion so e mû wala peut-être ti changé ni.	Keep in mind that there is a difference between extending a gift for a legitimate service and offering a bribe for an unlawful favor.	905	There are times when we will do well to reconsider a decision and perhaps change it.	146
Tongana a yeke ti mû na mo wango na ndo aye so kpale ayeke dä, tongana mozoko, salango ngia nga na lekengo tele pendere, hinga biani so babâ na mama ti mo ayeke fa na mo aye ni kue tâ gi na lege ni pëpe.	The eyes of such unbelievers are ‘veiled’ from the good news.	125	Of course, do not expect your parents to judge matters perfectly when they have to give you guidelines in difficult areas, such as music, entertainment, and grooming.	132
Me ngbanga ti nyen a lingbi Jésus abâ pasi nga lo kui?	Brother Rutherford requested that we arrange conventions in several cities in the western United States and send speakers to try to encourage the friends as much as possible.”	315	Why, though, was it necessary for Jesus to suffer and die?	438
A hiri deba nzoni na ndo ala na lege so ala yeke na Tene ti Nzapa so asû na mbeti nga fango lege ti ndoye na lege ti bungbi ti ala so asa yingo na ndo ti ala na ndo sese.	“The wages sin pays is death,” wrote the apostle Paul, “but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”	637	They are blessed with having God’s written Word and loving guidance through his anointed class on earth.	181
Ye oko, zia e tene pëpe so Jéhovah ayeke bi bê oko pëpe na apasi so awakua ti lo ayeke bâ.	Tomorrow go out against them, and Jehovah will be with you.’”​—2 Chronicles 20:15-17.	898	However, we should not conclude that Jehovah is insensitive to any suffering that his servants may experience in the meantime.	840
Songo ti azo so kue ayeke duti ande tongana nyen na ngoi so a yeke zingo ande azo na kuâ?	An announcement will also be made if the congregation needs to be informed.	797	(Luke 20:27-33) What relationship will such ones have in the resurrection?	193
Ngangu wa Nzapa asara na kua ti sara na sese? Ambeni ye wa lo sara na yâ ti akozo ota lango so lo sara na aye?	There was no arrangement for divorce or for having more than one mate at the same time.	76	God used what force when he created the earth, and what were some developments during the first three creative days?	596
A zia lani Jérémie na yâ olombo, a kanga lo na yâ ti da, na a bi lo na yâ mbeni dungu (Jérémie 20:2; 37:15; 38:6).	Another brother might have feelings of inadequacy about fulfilling an assignment.	558	(Jeremiah 20:2; 37:15; 38:6) He suffered this abuse at the hands of the very people whom he wished to help.	796
AZO WA LA MBI YEKE FA TËNË NA ALA?	(Read Revelation 13:1, 2.)	715	WHOM AM I APPROACHING?	382
Tongana e yeda na bê ti e kue ti sara akua so azo abâ tongana abuba kua, e yeke fa so e yeke na tâ be-ti-molenge, na tongaso e yeke mû peko ti Christ.	(James 1:27) So stay close to God’s people, never isolating yourself.​—Proverbs 18:1; Romans 14:7.	699	By willingly completing tasks that seem lowly, we show humility and thus follow in the footsteps of Christ.	156
Tongana e fa ndoye na azo, si ala kue asara mara ni na e, a yeke sara e nzoni mingi.	We would also be resisting and grieving Jehovah, the source of holy spirit.	517	By giving and receiving love, we feel much more secure.	577
Ti mû maboko na azo so asara si mbi yeke na ngia lakue.”	‘How could that be,’ he wondered, ‘when smaller trees in the vicinity survived?’	109	Helping such people always brings happiness.”	127
Ye oko, a si na mo awe ti pensé so bango ndo ti e na ndo ti aye so e ku na mbage ti Nzapa ayeke na lege ni pëpe?	Judging the beasts adversely, God takes rulership away from them and destroys the fourth beast.	181	However, have you considered the possibility that our expectations of God could be based on a faulty premise?	675
Na angoi tongaso, mbi yeke gi ti duti gi mbi oko na mbeni ndo na mbi yeke toto nga mawa ti tere ti mbi ayeke sara mbi.”	I appreciated how patient and helpful the brothers were in training me.	868	At such moments, I am inclined to isolate myself and give way to weeping and feelings of self-pity.”	964
Mbeni tapande: Jésus asambela ndali ti adisciple ti lo.​—Jean 17:9-17.	(Rom. 13:8-10) This is especially so when we are engaging in Christian activities, such as when we attend meetings or when we share in the preaching work.	732	Example: Jesus prayed in behalf of his followers.​—John 17:9-17.	749
Ngbanga ti nyen a haka Satan na mbeni zo ti gbungo andeke?	He sang: “As for me, the drawing near to God is good for me.	349	Why is Satan likened to a birdcatcher?	854
Ye oko, tënë so a kiri pekoni na nzobe so angbâ lakue andu aye mingi ahon sarango nzoni na zo so ndoye si apusu zo ti sara ni.	To whom, then, would the Messiah come?	195	However, the original-language word for loving-kindness means more than kindness stemming from love.	343
Mo peut ti diko achapitre ni so peut-être gi na yâ ti minute 15 ti si na 20, na bê ti mo ayeke dö ande ti bâ so Jésus asara kua lani gi na atënë so ayeke simple.	He has come to know of differences in viewpoint between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome.	443	You can read those chapters in perhaps 15 to 20 minutes, and you will be amazed to find how simple yet powerful Jesus’ words are.	327
Tongana e kiri e bâ tënë ti Paul na gbele Agrippa, bâ tongana nyen Paul ‘afa nda ti tënë ti Nzapa na lege ni’ na salango tënë ti aye so Moïse na aprophète afa.​—2 Timothée 2:15.	What Can We Learn From the Archives?	568	Returning to Paul’s defense before Agrippa, notice how Paul ‘handled God’s word aright’ by referring to things stated by Moses and the prophets.​—2 Timothy 2:15.	793
• Ngbanga ti nyen a yeke kota ye ti tene zo aleke tënë na ita so bê ti lo ason na tere ti lo?	And how did the Father feel as his Son was nailed to a wooden pole and left there to die a slow, agonizing death?	492	• Why is it important to make peace with an offended brother?	563
Paul akpengba na lege ti yingo nga peut-être lo yeke lani mbeni membre ti bebungbi na ngoi ti akozo Chrétien. Me ngbanga ti nyen lo tene: “So mawa na mbi”?	WHOM AM I APPROACHING?	370	Now, why would Paul​—a spiritual “giant” who likely was a member of the first-century governing body—​call himself a “miserable man”?	354
8 Mbeni kpale ni nde ayeke nga dä na tënë ti Israël so atene, ni gbian bê ti ni awe.	Sadly, some parents have allowed their children to attend unsupervised parties where several in attendance have been enticed into immorality or other unseemly conduct.	221	8 There was another problem with Israel’s repentance.	423

(aGalate 6:1) Ye oko, ti wara nzoni na yâ kota ngangu so, a hunda ti bi bê na mba ahon ti kasa ndo.	I feel truly blessed to have such a rich spiritual heritage.	594	(Genesis 4:6, 7) How loving it is when those having spiritual qualifications try to readjust the erring one in a spirit of mildness! (Galatians 6:1) To succeed in this endeavor, though, it is necessary to act out of concern rather than with a critical spirit.	527
Peut-être dutingo ti ala ayeke nde nde tongana ti so dutingo ti Moïse ayeke nde na ti amaseka so ayeke aHébreu na Égypte ti giriri.	Humans suffer privation, sickness, and loss.	744	He had all the opportunities of the royal court, while other Hebrews were slaves.	176
Legeoko na atënë ti bazengele Pierre, ala ‘ndoye aita ti ala kue’ so ayeke na kota ‘kpengo mbito ti Nzapa.’ (1 Pierre 2:17).	Similarly, we look to Jehovah in order to discern his will and to gain his favor.	522	Jehovah’s Witnesses are outstanding in this respect because they enjoy protection in familylike congregations around the earth.	167
JÉHOVAH, so ayeke zo ti mungo na e “nzoni matabisi kue nga na matabisi so alingbi kue”, alingbi biani ti tene e mû merci na lo (Jacq. 1:17).	That would include their speaking to others, to outsiders, about their faith in Jesus and their wonderful hope.	21	JEHOVAH, the Giver of “every good gift and every perfect present,” is indeed worthy of our thanks.	115
12 Tongana Bible asara tënë ti ‘kiringo na aye na nzoni lege,’ aye ti tene ti sara si mbeni ye aga nzoni wala atambela na lege ni.	(Deuteronomy 11:8) At Leviticus 20:22, 24, that same land is mentioned: “You people must keep all my statutes and all my judicial decisions and do them, that the land to which I am bringing you to dwell in it may not vomit you out.	414	12 The Greek term translated “setting things straight” means “to make good, to correct, to restore to a proper, upright condition.”	104
Aye ni so la ayeke mû lege na azo ti hinga “ngoi so aye ti ngoi so ayeke gue ti hunzi” na so ayeke gue juska ti si na ngoi so “nda ni ayeke ga.”	When we allow personal differences to cause disunity, we have provided “the birdcatcher” a foothold.	790	That sign would mark “the conclusion of the system of things” and lead to the time when “the end will come.”	280
Na popo ti azo so, a yeke wara aita ti mama ti mbi: Abdullah, na George Ghantous.	Even though the male publisher is not yet baptized, outsiders identify him with the congregation because of his preaching activity.	966	Among them were my uncles Abdullah and George Ghantous.	746
(Diko Psaume 1:1-3.) Atâ Chrétien ayeke bâ lakue Bible “tongana tënë so alondo na azo pëpe, me tongana tënë ti Nzapa, na a yeke tënë ti lo biani”.	What else can we learn from the Bible?	959	Its counsel is timeless, and those who carefully follow it will lead successful and happy lives.	755

Ahon ti haka lo na mbeni zo nde, gi ti bâ aye so anzere na mo mingi na mbage ti lo (aGalate 6:4). Edmond so lo sara mariage lege use awe atene: “Tongana ti so kamarade so mbeni zo asara kozo ayeke nde na ti so lo sara na mbeni fini zo, ngbene mariage ti mo ayeke nde na fini mariage ni.”	The Bible refers to the Law given to Israel as “the Law of Moses.” (1 Ki. 2:3) Nevertheless, the Scriptures identify Jehovah as the actual Lawgiver, and Moses himself was subject to that Law.	945	(Galatians 6:4) A man named Edmond, who has been married twice, puts it this way, “Just as no two friendships are the same, so no two marriages are the same.”	678

I was greatly impressed by the international brotherhood of Jehovah’s people.	479	(Psalm 22:10) Strong families do things together as a unit​—even if parents must sacrifice time that could be used to personal advantage.	65
17 Sandi, mbeni Témoin ti Amerika, afa nga so lo yeke bi bê na ala so lo yeke fa tënë na ala.	See Daniel 4:23-25.	132	17 Sandi, a Witness in the United States, also shows personal interest in those to whom she preaches.	476
Mbeni lâ, Jéhovah asara tënë ti Jésus, lo tene lo yeke “Molenge ti mbi so mbi ndoye lo mingi, lo so bê ti mbi anzere na lo mingi.”	For these, they rightly deserved to be left alone to die.	300	Jehovah later referred to Jesus as “my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”	640
Me, ala fono ti sala ngia pëpe.	However, he left some clues that might explain this Pharisee’s indecision.	544	These were not pleasure cruises.	696
Ruth so ayeke wali ti mbeni molenge ti Naomi so akui aga wali ti Boaz na lo dü molenge ti koli.	6, 7. (a) To what might we compare the storm and waves that surrounded Peter? (b) Why should we take seriously the possibility that our faith could diminish?	43	Naomi’s widowed daughter-in-law Ruth became the wife of Boaz and gave birth to a son.	874
Jérusalem ayeke ga “tongana kpangba na yâ yaka ti vigne”	(Revelation 20:10) Do not let Satan succeed in this scheme to destroy your faith.	931	Jerusalem was to become “like a booth in a vineyard”	394

A lingbi azo so nga ahinga Jéhovah.	(Genesis 41:16, 38, 39) By means of his spirit, Jehovah caused his purposes to be revealed to humble ones but hidden from proud ones.	823	These people too need to learn about Jehovah.	278
Gi vizite oko so alingbi biani ti mû lege na Ferdinand ti hinga na bê ti lo kue so Bible ayeke na akiringo tënë na ahundango tënë so lo yeke gi bê ti lo dä.

Na a dë bê ti e so tongana Nzapa aleke ti sala mbeni ye, lo yeke sala ni biani (Esaïe 55:11).	Instead, Jesus taught his followers a lesson about Jehovah by highlighting a contrast between that judge and God.	655	(Isaiah 55:11) So, then, what did God originally purpose for mankind, and how will it all work out?	113

Ti sara ni, e yeke na bezoin ti kpe aye ti sioni kue so alingbi ti sara si lê ti e akpengba pëpe na ndo ti tënë ti gango ti Jésus.	Especially when I feel low, prayer brings relief and helps me maintain my joy.	236	(Matt. 24:42) To do that, we need to guard against negative influences that could cause us not to be alert and vigilant with respect to Jesus’ coming.	534

(Rev. 7:9) Those healings reflected his deep feelings and showed just how much love God’s firstborn Son has for mankind.	985	(Psalm 104:5; Isaiah 45:18) It is this corrupt world system of things, not the literal planet, that will meet its permanent end, as if destroyed by fire.	514

[Picture on page 32]	15	Yet, 60 years after Jesus uttered the above words, the aged apostle John employed similar language, writing: “Down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.”​—Revelation 12:9.	443

Me, legeoko tongana ti so ando ti sukulango ngu ti Rome ayeke lani na ambeni ye so alingbi ti sala sioni na akozo Chrétien, laso ambeni ndo ti hungo tele ayeke nga mbeni gbanda so Satan azia ti pusu na aChrétien ti ngoi ti e ti tï na yâ pitan wala nyongo samba ahon ndo ni.	Or the one who takes the initiative to approach the other may do so in a self-righteous, critical manner.	972	However, just as the Roman baths included features that were potentially dangerous for the early Christians, some vacation facilities and resorts have proved to be a trap Satan has used to lead modern-day Christians into immorality or overdrinking.	597
Na pekoni so ababâ na amama asara lisoro na amolenge ti ala nga amolenge ni ahinga ye so ayeke si na ala tongana ala ke ti sara ye alingbi na andia ni, a lingbi ababâ na amama asara ye alingbi na ye so ala tene.

11 Na yâ ti Bible, a wara atapande mingi so alingbi ti mû maboko na e ti lango pëpe.	Writing such an open letter was unwise, for our letters were censored.	317	11 The Bible contains many warning examples that can help us to keep on the watch.	923
Ye oko alingbi ti kanga lege na Jéhovah pëpe ti sala aye kue so lo leke ti sala.	(1 Tim. 2:5, 6) As a legal Mediator, Jesus has made possible the birth of a new nation, “the Israel of God,” composed of Christians who will form a heavenly “royal priesthood.”​—Gal. 6:16; 1 Pet. 2:9.	85	Jehovah unfailingly carries out his purposes.	863

It is unwise to circulate unverified reports	549	(Revelation 2:10) Worshipers of Jehovah God realize that veneration of these true saints is unscriptural and cannot bring protection from sickness, natural disasters, economic instability, old age, or death.	686
Na tapande, teti so e kpe mbito ti Nzapa na e sala ye so ayeke mbilimbili, lo yeke fa nzobe ti lo na e, nga e yeke ndulu na lo na lege ti yingo (Kusala 10:34, 35; Jacques 4:8).	Knowing Jehovah includes having a close bond of love with him and with fellow believers.	935	(Psalm 71:5; 116:12) Because we fear God and practice righteousness, for instance, we enjoy his approval and are spiritually close to him.	470
Nde na so, Jésus afa na adisciple ti lo mbeni kpengba ye ti manda na ndo Jéhovah na lege so lo gboto lê ti ala na ndo kangbi so ayeke na popo ti Nzapa na juge so.	2. How can we exhibit “all mildness toward all men”?	411	Instead, Jesus taught his followers a lesson about Jehovah by highlighting a contrast between that judge and God.	417
13 Guengo na li ni ti tene ni na ando nde nde ayeke mbeni fä ti kota ndoye ti Jéhovah teti azo so a lingbi ti ton ala.	But I say to you that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman . . .”	433	13 This geographical growth was an expression of Jehovah’s deep love for redeemable humankind.	744

Ye so asara Jonathan nzoni oko ape.	Joshua and Caleb, on the other hand, trusted in Jehovah.	731	Jonathan’s experience highlights a grim reality.	94
Kite ayeke dä ape so lo yeke ne lo ape.	At times, some young ones, like the prodigal son, may turn away from the truth.	293	Most likely that would not happen.	712
Même tongana ambeni wakua ti Jéhovah akui aye pëpe ti tene so Satan asö benda, ndali ti so Jéhovah ayeke zingo ala na kuâ (Jean 5:28, 29).	That service had already taken me to three continents, and the shipwreck was just one incident in an eventful life.	518	(John 5:28, 29) On the other hand, Satan’s prospects are bleak indeed.	694
Peut-être babâ ti Timothée aku lani ti tene lo manda mbeti a gue yongoro na ti ngbâ ti bâ lege ti dengo buze ti sewa ni.* Tara ti bâ sarango ye ti babâ ti Timothée tongana lo mä so Timothée asoro ti sara kusala ti missionnaire na tere ti Paul, mbeni kusala so alingbi ti zia fini ti Timothée na yâ ti kpale nga alingbi ti sara si lo wara kpale ti nginza!	At the sight of Jesus, Anna “began returning thanks to God and speaking about the child to all those waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance.”​—Luke 2:22-24, 36-38; Numbers 18:6, 7.	940	His father may well have expected him to seek higher education and to continue a family business.* Imagine how Timothy’s father may have reacted on discovering that Timothy preferred the dangers and financial uncertainties of missionary work with Paul!	23
(Ésaïe 11:9). Na ngoi ni kâ ande, azo kue ayeke manda aye so Jéhovah Nzapa aye nga ala yeke sara ye na ndoye tongana lo.	Apostate leaders were a trap and a net for the Israelites, enticing them to practice idolatry.	61	(Isaiah 11:9) At that time, all mankind will learn Jehovah God’s ways and imitate his loving personality.	520
Nga, atâa so Jésus ayeke fadeso Gbia na yayu, lo ngbâ lakue ti mû maboko na adisciple ti lo ti sara si azo ahinga iri ti Jéhovah na ndo ti sese kue.	God’s promises have never failed, and they never will. (Isaiah 55:10, 11) Would you like to see this change?	40	(Ex. 34:5-7) Moreover, from Jesus’ glorified position in heaven, he continues to help his disciples to make known Jehovah’s name throughout the earth.	791
So tâ fango lege la ape, me a yeke gi so mo hinga ti kanga ndo ti ngonzo ti mo ape.	The four brothers had indicated their desire to serve together in the same country​—if possible.	220	Furthermore, punishment motivated by anger or frustration is not discipline at all.	802
5 Gbâ ti awakua ti Jéhovah so ayeke be-ta-zo awara ândö akpale ti seni.	However, the Bible does not portray the garden that way.	268	5 Many faithful servants of Jehovah have had to contend with health problems.	233
(Daniel 7:13, 14). Ngu use na pekoni, Daniel abâ mbeni ye tongana suma na ndo ti Médie na Perse, Grèce nga na mbeni ye so achangé aga ‘gbia so lê ti lo ahili mingi’, wala so lê ti lo akpa ti zo so asara ye na ngangu mingi.​—Daniel 8:23.	What will help you to recall Bible passages when you need them to help others?	14	(Daniel 7:13, 14) Two years later, Daniel has a vision that involves Medo-Persia, Greece, and an entity that becomes “a king fierce in countenance.”​—Daniel 8:23.	301
Na salango tënë ti singo ti lo nga na ti hunzingo ti aye ti ngoi ti laso, Jésus atene: “Zo nyen ayeke boi ti nzoni na ti ndara [wala “ngbâa be-ta-zo na ti ndara”, NW ]? so mveni ti lo azia lo na ndo azo ti da ti lo ti kangbi kobe na ala na l’heure ni so alingbi.	Still, the number of those who actually preached from house to house was small at first.	69	Commenting on his presence and the conclusion of the system of things, Jesus said: “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?	477
Kite ayeke dä pëpe so Aristarque na Gaïus aku ti wara kuâ, me wakuasu ti gbata ni asara si azo ni azia ti dekongo.​—Kusala 19:23-41.	● Children must adopt their parents’ beliefs about God without question.	601	Aristarchus and Gaius probably expected to die, but the city recorder quieted the crowd.​—Acts 19:23-41.	950
Na dutingo ndulu na bungbi so, fade zo ni ayeke duti na ngia ti sala songo na ambeni zo so alingbi ti kpengba lo na so ayeke voro Nzapa beoko na “yingo na tene-biani” nga.	(Read 1 Peter 4:10.)	17	Then, by associating with that group, one will enjoy upbuilding fellowship with people who worship God in unity and “with spirit and truth.”	797
Lo hinga so ti tene lo kpe loro ni nzoni, a lingbi lo te ambeni kobe ape nga lo sara pëpe ambeni ye so tanga ti azo ayeke sara.	(Ephesians 4:31) Note that before citing “screaming and abusive speech,” Paul mentioned “malicious bitterness and anger and wrath.”	74	He no doubt had to be different to get to that level.	887
Ye so lo sala afa so lo yeke be-biani pëpe?	Once my condition had stabilized, I had an operation to implant a pacemaker.	482	Was this an act of disloyalty?	460
Gbotongo mê wa Samuel amû na ndo ti “ye senge”?	“There Is Pleasantness at Your Right Hand Forever”	176	What warning about pursuing “unrealities” did Samuel deliver?	338
Ndoye ti e teti amba ti e ayeke pusu e ti fa nzo tënë ti Royaume, atâa ngoi oke si Nzapa alingbi ti hunda na e ti sala ni, nga atâa fani oke si e lingbi ti kiri ti fa tënë gi na a-oko da ni.	After four months, I selected a brother as my pioneer partner.	956	15 Christian love is an outstanding quality because it is the underlying motive for everything we do. We serve Jehovah because we love him, irrespective of his timetable.	703
Ni la, atâa so zo awara ngangu ti komande na ndo ti anyama, a lingbi lo sala ye pëpe ahon katikati ti ngangu ti komande so a mû ni na lo, me lo sala kusala na ni alingbi na akpengba-ndia ti Mbeti ti Nzapa.	However, have you considered the possibility that our expectations of God could be based on a faulty premise?	374	Thus, while man has dominion over animals, he should not abuse that authority but use it in harmony with the principles of God’s Word.	309
Ye ni asigigi polele na ngoi ti mungo temple ni na yâ ti sambela so Salomon asara, lo tene: “Tongana awande ayeke, lo so ayeke ti azo ti Mo Israël pëpe, lo so alondo na mbeni sese yongoro, na lo ga tënë ti kota iri ti Mo, wala tënë ti tïtî Mo ti ngangu, wala tënë ti tïtî ti Mo so Mo ye na ndo azo, tongana ala ga na ala bâ ndo na mbage ti da so na ala sambela, Mo mä tënë so na yayu, ndo ti duti ti Mo, na Mo sara ye kue so awande so ahunda Mo dä, si azo kue ti sese alingbi hinga iri ti Mo, si ala kpe mbeto ti Mo legeoko tongana azo ti Mo Israël asara, na ala lingbi hinga a di iri ti Mo na tere ti da so mbi sara.” (2 Chron. 6:32, 33). Même na ngoi ti Jésus, azo so ayeke azo ti Israël ape, so aye ti voro Jéhovah, alingbi ti voro lo gi tongana ala bungbi oko na azo ti lo so lo te mbele na ala.—Jean 12:20; Kus. 8:27.	(Rom. 1:12; read Proverbs 27:17.)	430	13 When Solomon’s temple was dedicated to Jehovah, provision was made for non-Israelite worshippers, as reflected in Solomon’s prayer: “Concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people Israel and who comes from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, and he comes and prays toward this house, may you then listen from the heavens, your dwelling place, and do all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as your people Israel do, and may know that your name has been called on this house that I have built.” (2 Chron. 6:32, 33) As was still true in Jesus’ day, any non-Israelite who wished to worship Jehovah would want to associate with His covenant people.​—John 12:20; Acts 8:27.	107
Ti sö kuâ, mbi kpe mbi gue na kete kodoro ti sala kua teti kete nginza tongana zo ti fango yaka.	9 Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles, thus demonstrating that they had Jehovah’s backing.	582	In order to survive, I fled to the countryside to work for meager wages as a field hand.	234
Fa mbeni tapande.	(Galatians 6:4) A man named Edmond, who has been married twice, puts it this way, “Just as no two friendships are the same, so no two marriages are the same.”	396	Illustrate.	102

(Diko Zacharie 6:9-12.)	(Matthew 4:4; John 4:34) If you talk about emotional wounds each time you open the Bible, you could cause your mate to lose his or her spiritual appetite.	335	(Read Zechariah 6:9-12.)	550
Ye so amû lege mingi na ala ti “kpengba tere na popo” ti ala. (aRom.	(2 Ki. 5:11) And if the counsel touches a particularly sensitive area​—the actions of a family member, our dress and grooming, our personal hygiene, or a form of recreation that we enjoy but that Jehovah hates—​we might react quite negatively, to our own surprise and to our counselor’s dismay!	499	This provides more opportunities for “an interchange of encouragement.”	208

He told them: “I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.”​—Acts 20:29, 30.	711	Of course, there are other characteristics that identify a truly spiritual person, but how do you measure up to those already considered?	511
Lo wa azo so amä lo: “I gi bê ti i pëpe, na i tene pëpe, Fade e te nyen? wala, Fade e nyon nyen? wala, Fade e yü bongo ti nyen?	It is fitting, then, that God should use a special expression of his authority to end human suffering and accomplish his original purpose for the earth.	284	He admonished his listeners: “Never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing.	649
Tongana e luti kpô na nduzu, na ngoi so tanga ti azo ni ayeke bala drapeau, atâ Chrétien ayeke fa polele so ala yeke na yekiango ndo atâa ala mû mbage ti ala dä pëpe.

Na ndo ni, kengo yanga ti Satan amû lege na Jéhovah ti fa na gigi anzoni sarango ye ti lo na mbeni lege so ayeke kota mingi.	4, 5. (a) Why is it important to teach with love? (b) In teaching, why are knowledge and skill also important?	214	In addition, Satan’s rebellion has given Jehovah an opportunity to demonstrate His fine qualities in a more pronounced way.	351
Ni la Josué aye ti hinga wala lo na azo ti lo alingbi ti hon ala na ngangu.	2 We read at Genesis 12:11-13: “It came about that as soon as he got near to entering Egypt, then he said to Sarai his wife: ‘Please, now! I well know you are a woman beautiful in appearance.	242	Joshua wanted to know just what he and his men would be facing.	165
‘Ti tâ tene ni, lo yeke fa ye nzoni mingi ahon mbi.’	In a comparable way, after the death of the apostles, “oppressive wolves” came from the ranks of anointed Christian elders.​—Acts 20:29, 30.	831	‘Frankly, he is a better teacher than I am.’	464
Bible atene: “Zo so ayeke na ndoye pëpe ahinga Nzapa pëpe.” (1 Jean 4:8).	From the Latin word utraque, which means “each of two.”	794	Knowing Jehovah includes having a close bond of love with him and with fellow believers.	654
Na sorongo ti sara siokpari na tere ti Nzapa, ala girisa teti ala wani nga teti ahale ti ala mara ti fini so Jéhovah aye fade ti tene ala duti na ni (Gen. 3:16-19).

Ahon ti tene mo pensé hio so ita ni alingbi ti ngbâ ancien encore ape, mo yeke kanga bê ti mo ti ku Jésus, li ti congrégation?	(Matt. 13:20, 21) To help avoid that outcome, we need to ask our student how he feels about what he is learning.	449	Rather than quickly concluding that the brother no longer qualifies as an elder, will you patiently wait on Jesus, the head of the congregation?	183
“Lo sambela aninga na gbele Jéhovah”.	11, 12. (a) How does Jehovah view our efforts to please him in our worship? (b) How might a person deceive himself into thinking that he is doing God’s will while in reality he is being disobedient?	89	Indeed, “she prayed for a long time before Jehovah.”	428
Na bango Jésus, Anne ‘amû singila na Nzapa, na lo sara tënë ti Molenge ni na ala kue so ayeke ku lâ ti ton Jérusalem.’​—Luc 2:22-24, 36-38; Nombre 18:6, 7.

Kota zo ti ekole ni amû même aye so lo yeke manda na Bible ni.	16 When we think about all that the ransom makes possible, does not our heart become filled with gratitude to Jehovah and his only-begotten Son?	882	He even confiscated her study materials.	494
Ti mo, a yeke tâ tënë so pasi so azo ti Nzapa abâ lani asara lo nzoni ape?	How would trusting in Jehovah’s promise have aided a person in obeying the law at Deuteronomy 15:7, 8?	356	Would you say, then, that God was affected by the suffering of his people?	447
Aye ota wa a lingbi ti mû maboko na e ti sara kua nzoni na atënë ti yanga ti e, e yeke sara tënë na ndo ni?	Paul said: “We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.”	269	What three aspects of speech will we consider?	602
Mbeni zo ni oko na popo ti ala bale-oko so “[akiri], na mungo gloire na Nzapa na kota go.”	16 Be “content with the present things.”	460	One of the ten men “turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.”	425
Na yâ ti Bible, a iri Ndia so a mû lani na azo ti Israël, “Ndia ti Moïse.” (1 aGbia 2:3).	15 Our task is not simply to tell people that if they turn to God, he will help them with all their problems and they will feel better.	986	The Bible refers to the Law given to Israel as “the Law of Moses.” (1 Ki. 2:3) Nevertheless, the Scriptures identify Jehovah as the actual Lawgiver, and Moses himself was subject to that Law.	396
10 A yeke nzoni ti bâ aparagraphe oke na ngoi ti mandango Bible na mbeni zo?	Joseph explained that Pharaoh’s two dreams had the same meaning.	895	10 How much material should be covered in one study session?	777
14 Azo ti gbe ti Royaume ti Nzapa ayeke laso na kota kusala ti “sara tënë ti témoin ti royaume ti Nzapa”.	In what ways did God’s spirit operate upon them?	304	14 Subjects of God’s Kingdom now have the crucial work of “bearing thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God.”	256
Ti tene ala wara mbeni fini so nda ni ayeke dä, azo kutu mingi abi tele ti ala na yâ abango ndo, asenda-ndara na avorongo nzapa nde nde.	There is no doubt that many among the elderly experience such distress.	253	In order to find a meaningful purpose in life, millions have experimented with various ideologies, philosophies, and religions.	878
9 Nyen la azo so ayeke ti Jéhovah alingbi ti manda na lege ti mbeti so a sû na tere ti “ngangu gere ti ye so Nzapa azia”?	What does it mean to dedicate oneself to Jehovah?	769	9 What lesson can we learn from the “seal” in Paul’s word picture?	326
Malachie 3:17 afa so bango ndo so lo yeke na ni na ndo ti ala ayeke tongana ti mbeni babâ na ndo ti molenge ti lo so lo ye lo mingi.	Aristarchus and Gaius probably expected to die, but the city recorder quieted the crowd.​—Acts 19:23-41.	669	As noted at Malachi 3:17, he views them in the way that a loving father views his son.	491
Akusala so e yeke sara na yanga-da, na ekole, na place ti kua, na ngoi so e gue ti vo ye nga na ambeni ye tongaso alingbi ti kpa aye so alingbi pëpe ti sara ngangu na ndo ti songo ti e na Jéhovah.	The need to keep our faith healthy can be likened to a plant’s need for water.	849	Housework, schoolwork, secular work, shopping, and the like might on the surface seem to have little to do with spiritual concerns.	583
Jésus atene na ambeni Juif atene ala ye ti mä tënë ti lo pëpe ndali ti so ‘ala ye ti sara aye so bê ti babâ ti ala Zabolo aye.’	Ask yourself: ‘Do I really know what God’s will is regarding mankind and the earth?	753	Jesus told certain Jews that they did not listen to his message because ‘they wished to do the desires of their father the Devil.’	8

Mbeni ita-wali so ade maseka atene: “Kozo ti tene mbi mû desizion ti wara batême, mbi manda lani Bible na mbi bâ so tâ bungbi ti vorongo Nzapa la.	His Origin Was “From Early Times”	435	One teenage sister said: “Before I decided to get baptized, I studied the Bible and saw that this is the true religion.	492
(Psaume 26:11).	14 Isaac surely had the ability to fight for his right to use all the wells that his servants had dug.	223	(Psalm 26:11) In his prayer for forgiveness of sins, he admits: “When I kept silent my bones wore out through my groaning all day long.”	835
Nze osio na pekoni, mbi soro mbeni ita-koli pionnier ti tene mbi na lo e sara kua ni.	1, 2. (a) How can fear protect us physically? (b) Why do wise parents endeavor to instill a wholesome fear in their children?	559	After four months, I selected a brother as my pioneer partner.	674
Tongaso, ngbâ lakue ti sala na Nzapa, Lo so aye gi nzoni ti mo.	How, though, can we show that we trust in Jehovah completely in times of financial distress?	451	Continue, therefore, to serve the God who has your best interests at heart.	809

Ala komande asusu . . . anyama so ayeke huru . . . na anyama oko oko kue so ayeke na fini si ayeke tambela na ndö ti sese.”	Can you see yourself enjoying the things that God has promised?	736	He was not satisfied with his extensive freedom to carry out his God-given mandate: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish . . . , the flying creatures . . . , and every living creature that is moving on the earth.”	84

Legeoko nga, na yâ sewa, mingi ni a yeke azo use si ayeke sala kusala ti leke amolenge.	(Luke 21:34, 35; Mark 4:18, 19) Because of our imperfect human nature, we might leave ‘the love we had at first.’	774	Comparably, in the family there are usually two who share in molding the children.	247
Aye so ambeni wasungo Bible asû na gbe ti yingo ti Nzapa ti fa nda ti atënë so andu tâ mabe ti aChrétien, lo mä yâ ni nzoni?

(Mark 8:34; John 3:3; 6:53; 17:14, 16) The proud, the rich, and the hypocritical viewed these requirements as too difficult to fulfill.	843	(Rom. 12:1) “Consequently,” or in view of the fact that Christians are declared righteous because of their faith, what follows should affect their attitude toward themselves, others, and governmental authorities.	220
Atâa so koli ni ayeke wafango tënë so ade ti wara batême pëpe, azo ti gigi ayeke bâ lo tongana oko ti kongregation ngbanga ti so lo yeke fa tënë.

Na ngoi so ‘bê ti e afâ’ wala ‘yingo ti e ayeke na vundu’, lo yeke ga nduru na e.	5 Satan’s revolt is still going strong.	793	When we are “broken at heart” or “crushed in spirit,” he draws near to us.	612
Fade Mbi zia Berger oko na ndo ala; na fade Lo mû kobe na ala, même Boi ti Mbi David, fade Lo fa ndo ti tengo pere na ala, na fade Lo ga Berger ti ala.”	(Matt. 9:37, 38) For instance, many thousands of our young people who recently graduated from school have expanded their ministry and are now experiencing the joy that comes from zealously serving as pioneers.	274	And I will raise up over them one shepherd, and he must feed them, even my servant David.	831
Ti ambeni molenge so mê ti ala akanga, a yeke kanga même maboko ti ala na peko na ngoi so a yeke fa mbeti na ala.	(Matt. 19:21, 22) Ensnared by riches, that man lost out on a great privilege​—that of being able to follow the greatest man who ever lived!	116	Some deaf children even had their hands tied behind their back during lessons.	20
Me ti myrrhe, tongana a zi ngu so ayeke na yâ ni, a yeke sara gi kua na ngu ti Myrrhe ni so droit awe.	Just as Jesus said earlier, “even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.”	586	The resin extracted from myrrh, on the other hand, was used directly.	901
Lakue lo yeke mû na e aye so e yeke na bezoin ni atâa nyen la asi.”	Now I have a loving, understanding Father to whom I can pour out my feelings and my most intimate fears.	115	He always cares for our needs, no matter what happens.”	689

The book Between Resistance and Martyrdom​—Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Third Reich relates the comments of a young Jewish prisoner, in which he describes his first encounter with Jehovah’s Witnesses after he arrived at the Neuengamme concentration camp:	562	Of what must the elders be conscious, and why? 21 Of course, the older men are not perfect. Mindful of their limitations, they do not try to lord it over the flock, “God’s inheritance.”	175
Peut-être kozoni si mo mä kiringo tënë ni, mo ye ti hinga ambeni tënë si.	Yes, now is the time to learn to work together, to cultivate the unity that will be so vital in the days ahead.	507	Before answering, you might want to know more.	69

(Isaiah 25:8; 65:17-25) Jehovah is his own witness to these grand promises!	760	What, though, about such grievous sins as stealing, intentional lying, sexual immorality, drunkenness, and so on?	568
E tene tongaso ndali so, atâa so azo a hinga pëpe tongana nyen la a yeke di iri ti Nzapa, iri ti lo angbâ.	Use of such mills was a daily chore for the women or the servants of virtually every household.	579	Granted, its exact pronunciation cannot now be determined, but the name has endured.	824

Amiracle so amû lege na e ti hinga biani so a yeke kaï akobela ti e ande kue kue kue.	No, for the prophet Jeremiah accurately declared: “I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong.	281	(Rev. 7:9) Those healings reflected his deep feelings and showed just how much love God’s firstborn Son has for mankind.	422

Many find it hard to imagine that humans could acquire a close, loving friendship with Almighty God, an invisible Spirit in heaven.	33	15 Our task is not simply to tell people that if they turn to God, he will help them with all their problems and they will feel better.	945
