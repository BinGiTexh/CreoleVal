Ye oko, tongana Jéhovah ahunda na awakua ti lo ti yeda na wango-tene ti lo, lo yeke sala pëpe tënë ti sengo awasiokpari so agbian bê pëpe.	Draw Close to God	35	It is significant that the Bible does not describe Jehovah primarily as a punisher.	651

A mû na ala kota yango-iri na kota matabisi so ahon atanga ni kue so mbeni zo alingbi ti wara ni pëpe (Matthieu 7:13, 14; 1 Pierre 2:9).	6 Who will remain in place of wicked people?	86	(Matthew 7:13, 14; 1 Peter 2:9) Like that traveling merchant, they had given up much to follow Jesus in pursuit of the Kingdom.	114
(Psaume 121:2). Ngbanga ti nyen wasungo psaume so ahinga biani so Jéhovah ayeke mû maboko na lo?	If that ever happens to you, turn to Jehovah and his people for help so as not to allow yourself to be deprived of the prize.​—Read Psalm 34:18; Proverbs 13:20.	511	(Psalm 121:2) Why was this psalmist convinced that Jehovah would help him?	332
Gi na peko ti so lo zia gere ti da ni na sese awe, mbeni zo aga na abuba ni.	Nonetheless, are we not thankful that Jehovah uses his spirit to qualify and equip us as teachers of his Word?	830	Just as he lays the foundation, someone comes along and destroys what has been laid.	174
Jésus afa kozoni awe tënë ti gbâ ti aye ti vundu so ayeke si na ngoi ti nda ni so.	“Practice giving, and people will give to you,” said Jesus. “They will pour into your laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together and overflowing.	241	Sadly, Israel ignored that divine message and failed to take the right action.	685
Nga, bazengele Pierre asû na mbeti: “I hinga [i aChrétien so asa yingo na ndo ti i], A ton i na yâ tënë senge senge so akotara ti i afa na i giriri; A ton i pëpe na ye so ayeke futi, ye tongana argent wala lor, me A ton i na mênë ti Christ so ngele ni ayeke ngangu, mênë so ayeke tongana mênë ti molenge ti ngasangbaga so ayeke nzoni kue na sioye ayeke na tele ti lo pëpe.”​—1 Pierre 1:18, 19.	(Titus 1:16) The apostle Peter likewise warned that false teachers would “quietly bring in destructive sects and [would] disown even the owner that bought them.”	422	And the apostle Peter wrote: “You [anointed Christians] know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were delivered from your fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from your forefathers. But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.”​—1 Peter 1:18, 19.	943
(Mat. 9:36; Marc 6:34). E yeke na araison kue ti yapu na yâ ti tâ vorongo tongana ti so Jésus ayapu lani na yâ ni.	Children thrive on loving attention and commendation	479	(Matt. 9:36; Mark 6:34) We have every reason to be zealous for true worship, as Jesus was.	872
Tongana e zia bê ti e na nginza nga na akungba, e yeke wara vundu.	“But one day, you say to yourself, ‘It’s my religion because these are my convictions.’” Like many other young Witnesses of Jehovah, Amélie knows that her solid religious convictions give her a purpose in life and are a source of lasting happiness.	692	Material possessions do not deliver; they are unrealities.	21
Ye so asara si mbi bâ so lo ye mbi mingi na mbi sara ngonzo pëpe ndali ti angoi so lo mû teti kongregation.”	They give of their time, energy, and resources to promote pure worship.	244	As a result, I felt loved and was not jealous of the time he spent serving the congregation.”	238
A yeke bâ ni na yâ ti sarango tënë ti wali.	Why might some hesitate to study the Bible, and how may you help them to overcome their reluctance?	688	Her role is reflected in the way she communicates.	539
Mbeti ti Lévitique alingbi ti mû maboko na e tongana nyen?	(Col. 1:6, 23) To illustrate: Because of what the apostle Paul said and did on the island of Cyprus, the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus “became a believer, for he was astounded at the teaching of Jehovah.”​—Read Acts 13:6-12.	398	How can the book of Leviticus help us?	363
A-Chrétien ayeke na kpengba mabe na zingongo ti akuâ so Jésus asara tënë ni (Jean 5:28, 29).	The pain was excruciating, but despite the pain I went to work the next day.	460	(John 5:28, 29) What does that prospect do for the surviving mate?	548
Tâ gingo bê so ala yeke na ni ndali ti lo, so ti tene tâ ndoye, apusu ala ti sara ye hio ndali ti nzoni ti lo. Sarango tongaso azi lege na lo nga na azo ti da ti lo kue ti mä na bê (Kus. 16:19-34).	Moreover, the murmurers did not act as troublemakers and raise their voices against Jehovah.	200	Their sincere concern for his welfare​—their self-sacrificing love—​moved them to act swiftly in his behalf, opening the way for the jailer and his entire household to become believers.	151
A yeke mbeni ye so ade ti si lâ oko pëpe na yâ ti mbaï ti azo (Apoc. 7:9, 10).	Why is hard work needed to gain an accurate knowledge of God?	73	(Rev. 7:9, 10) Many young people are enjoying thrilling experiences as they help others to understand lifesaving Bible truths.	751
Ni la, a yeke na kota ngia nga na wâ mingi si e yeke bata komandema ti Nzapa ti sala si lumière aza na yâ bingo teti gloire ti Jéhovah.	Drinking wine was obviously acceptable to Jesus.	545	With great joy and zeal, then, we obey the divine command to let light shine out of darkness to Jehovah’s glory.	958
A ninga pëpe, a tomba lo nga na akamarade ti lo use na popo ti aturugu ni. Na pekoni, ala mû tele ti ala na Jéhovah Nzapa.	He also mentioned that he had changed his itinerary, informing them that he would first go to Macedonia and then to Corinth.​—1 Cor. 16:5, 6.*	215	Before long, he and two of his companions were expelled from the army, and they dedicated their lives to Jehovah God.	103
Kozo zo so lo mû matabisi so na lo ayeke kozo Molenge ti lo, so lo yeke “image ti Nzapa so lê ayeke bâ lo pëpe”. (aCol. 1:15).	They trusted in Jehovah. Were they blessed? Absolutely!	506	(Col. 1:15) Even before coming to earth, Jesus chose to remain loyal to his Father and not join Satan in his rebellion.	556
Atâa so Jéhovah azia lege na mbeni ye so ayeke na lege ni ape ti si, ye so asara si na nda ni a ‘gbu koko ti nzoni tënë na a sara si gere ni aluti ngangu na lege ti ndia.’ (aPhil. 1:7).	Before long, he and two of his companions were expelled from the army, and they dedicated their lives to Jehovah God.	101	(Phil. 1:7) Those city magistrates would think twice before doing anything against the newly formed Christian congregation in their city.	601
Yingo vulu ayeke mû maboko na e tongana nyen na fango tënë?	(Prov. 1:8, 9) After all, they want you to gain life, something far more valuable than wealth or prestige in this world.​—Matt. 16:26.	630	How does the holy spirit assist us in our preaching?	820
Wasungo-mbeti ti Grèce, Anna Stergiou, asû atënë so na yâ mbeni mbeti-sango ti Athènes: “Ngbele ye giriri, a fa na e ti ke aTurque.	Now, I feel that I can approach Jehovah without anything being in the way.”	322	“We have been taught to hate the Turks for years,” Greek columnist Anna Stergiou wrote in an Athens newspaper.	658
16 Ti duti na tâ be-ti-molenge ayeke mû maboko na koli na wali ti bâ na nene ni anzoni sarango ye nga na akode so mba ti lo ayeke na ni.	In fact, “statistics show that [in Europe] half of those who get married will divorce,” reports the Institute for Family Policy in Spain.	586	16 Humility and modesty help a married person focus on the strengths of his or her mate.	522
Jéhovah ake azo ti Israël so akangbi na awali ti ala na ndo asenge tënë na amû awali païen	(Eph. 5:33; Gen. 2:23, 24) Over time, the attachment a couple have to each other gains strength, as does their love for each other.	898	Jehovah condemned Israelites who divorced their wives on frivolous grounds and married pagan women	596
Ti gue legeoko na ye so, mbeni buku afa nda ti “sadaka” tongana “mbeni salango ye ti vorongo so na yâ ni zo amu mbeni ye na mbeni nzapa ti leke gere ti mbeni nzoni songo, ti bata ni, wala ti kiri ti leke ni, na popo ti lo na ye so a ba ni tongana nzoni-kue.”	(2) Paul also wrote that each person should give “in keeping with his income.” (1 Corinthians 16:2b, New International Version) In other words, an individual who wants to share in voluntary giving can do so proportionately.	665	In line with that, one reference work defines “sacrifice” as “a religious rite in which an object is offered to a divinity in order to establish, maintain, or restore a right relationship of man to the sacred order.”	591
4 Zo-ti-fa-tene 12:3 atene: “Fadeso, mo dabe mo na Lo so acréé mo, na lâ ti pendere ti mo.”	LUKE 21:11; REVELATION 6:8	587	4 Ecclesiastes 12:1 states: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.”	216
Etienne ayeke na nzoni iri na popo ti aita, ni la a soro lo ti duti oko ti akoli mbasambala, so a yeke sala nzoni tënë ti ala, ti bâ ndo na ndo kangbingo kobe ti lâ oko oko.	So imagine my joy and surprise when, in January 1946, I received an invitation to go to Bethel in London to help with the work there for three weeks.	427	Stephen had a fine reputation among the brothers and was therefore chosen to be one of seven certified men who would handle this daily distribution of food.	808
I sepela iri ti Jéhovah, I sepela Lo, O awakua ti Jéhovah, i so i luti na yâ da ti Jéhovah, na yâ sedu ti da ti Nzapa ti e.	With the assistance of a younger elder, José was able to continue serving joyfully as presiding overseer, and this has been a blessing to the congregation.	895	Praise the name of Jehovah, offer praise, O servants of Jehovah, you who are standing in the house of Jehovah, in the courtyards of the house of our God.	306
Tongaso, zia e bâ tënë na ndo ambeni lege so Jéhovah afa na gigi kota ndoye ti lo so.	4 Another woman who received her dead by resurrection lived in the town of Shunem.	3	Let us, then, examine some of the facets of Jehovah’s matchless love.	122
Lo tene: “Ngoi na ngoi, mbi bâ ndo na lê ti fenêtre na mbi yeke bâ aita ti mbi ti koli na ti wali na fango tënë da na da.	We Can Remain Chaste	224	“Sometimes,” she says, “I look out the window and see my Christian brothers and sisters preaching from house to house.	570
Mbi lingbi sala ye kue na yâ Lo so asala si mbi wara ngangu.”​—aPhilippien 4:11-13.	(Matthew 7:13, 14; 1 Peter 2:9) Like that traveling merchant, they had given up much to follow Jesus in pursuit of the Kingdom.	87	For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.”—Philippians 4:11-13.	492
Tongaso, na pekoni so mbi sambela mingi, mbi mû desizion so a lingbi mbi ngbâ ti mû maboko ti bata Joan.	18 As noted, a mature Christian can be a powerful influence for good in the congregation.	145	So after much prayer, I decided that I should stay to help care for Joan.	526
Mara ti bango ndo tongaso aluti na ndo ti tâ hingango ye, na “lê ti bê” aba ni na lege ti yingo. (aEphésien 1:18) Atene na akusala ti Jésus afa nga ye mingi na ndo Nzapa.	Jacob sought to make peace with Esau, but not because Jacob had erred against his brother and owed him an apology.	424	Such seeing is based on accurate knowledge and is perceived spiritually with ‘the eyes of the heart.’ (Ephesians 1:18) The words and deeds of Jesus also reveal much about God.	592
Legeoko tongana prophète Jérémie giriri, Pierre na Jean alingbi pëpe ti kanga yanga ti ala na yâ kusala ti fango tënë.​—Kusala 4:18-20; Jérémie 20:9.	Justin Martyr believed that hell was a fiery place	341	Like the ancient prophet Jeremiah, Peter and John could not hold back from carrying out their commission to preach.​—Acts 4:18-20; Jeremiah 20:9.	32
14 Na ngoi so aChrétien so ayeke ku ti gue na yayu, a yeke nzoni ala bâ tere ti ala tongana nyen?	Lies destroy friendships and marriages; they defraud people of countless millions of dollars.	476	14 How should these anointed ones view themselves as they await their heavenly reward?	614
Pharaon amû même yanga ti tene a fâ amolenge-koli kue ti Israël so ayeke dü ala.	Would adjusting your focus or goals allow you to acquire more wisdom?	867	Pharaoh even decrees death for all Israelite male infants.	206
Jéhovah aleke yâ ti a-ange nga na aye so ayeke na yayu tongana nyen?	You brought your wisdom to ruin on account of your beaming splendor.”	751	What organization exists in heaven?	729
Ye oko, mbeni ye achangé na mbage ti koli ti mbi na lege ti yingo pëpe.	(1 Thess. 2:7, 8) When elders are called upon to give counsel, their goal is to do so “with mildness,” even when speaking with those “not favorably disposed.” (2 Tim. 2:24, 25) Elders should also be gracious in expressing themselves in written correspondence when it is necessary to correspond with another body of elders or with the branch office.	238	Still, I saw no spiritual change in my husband.	264
NYEN LA AYEKE SI ANGOI KETE KOZO NA FUTINGO TI DUNIA SO?	Let us, then, examine some of the facets of Jehovah’s matchless love.	112	WHAT WILL HAPPEN JUST BEFORE THE END?	718
Tongana lo yeke sû mbeti na ndo abibe ti lo ti mbanda teti afon lo Chrétien ti kongregation ti Corinthe, Paul atene: “Mbi yeke na nzara [“mbanda”, NW] ti bata i, na [“mbanda﻿  so alondo na Nzapa; teti mbi mû i na Christ awe, legeoko tongana zo amû masia so ayeke na sioni oko pëpe na koli ti lo.” (2 aCorinthien 11:2).	PAGE 24	578	(1 Corinthians 5:11-13; 1 Timothy 5:20) Writing about his jealous feelings for fellow believers in the Corinthian congregation, Paul said: “I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, for I personally promised you in marriage to one husband that I might present you as a chaste virgin to the Christ.” (2 Corinthians 11:2) So, too, our jealousy moves us to do all we can to protect the doctrinal, spiritual, and moral purity of all in the congregation.	450
Azo so abâ ni alingbi ti yeda na ni.	Nathan was very progressive, always planning ahead for future growth.	179	Onlookers might agree.	141
Ndali ni la a yeke nzoni e sambela ti tene Royaume ti Nzapa aga nga ti tene a sara na sese ge ye so bê ti Nzapa aye.*	But we can do so in a figurative sense.	315	As Job well knew, God’s will is to resurrect the dead.	193
Adolfo atene so lo yeke na ngia ndali ti achangement so lo sara.	HOW grateful we can be for the operation of Jehovah’s holy spirit!	321	Adolfo says he is happy for the changes he has been able to make.	892
Mo bi bê ti mo na Lo na lege ti mo kue, na fade Lo sara si lege ti mo aga mbilimbili.”	These principles were a comfort to the psalmist, as they can be for God’s servants who are struggling to deal with the difficulties of modern life. 5.	782	In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”	478
Ambeni bungbi omene ti awandara asala kua angu bale-oko. Na pekoni, ala wara lege ti zi ti zia nde mbeni ye so na yâ mênë ti zo ayeke na gunda ti kobela ti Huntington, atâa so awandara ni ahinga oko pëpe lege so lo ga na kobela ni.	For a few weeks, they made a note of every meeting they attended.	591	After ten years of work by six teams of researchers, the gene linked to Huntington’s disease was isolated, although the researchers have no idea how the gene causes the disease.	275
Bible atene nyen na ndo ti a-ange?	(Matthew 5:37) Teenagers are less likely to argue with you when they know that you are consistent.	689	What does the Bible tell us about angels?	181
Na tapande, tara ti bâ wala atënë ti bê ti Abraham ayeke lani tongana nyen na ngoi so lo tambela teti lango ota ti gue na Morija alingbi na yanga so Nzapa amû na lo atene: “Mo kamata molenge ti mo, molenge ti mo ngengele oko, lo so mo ndoye lo, même Isaac; mo gue na sese ti Morija; mo mû lo kâ tongana offrande so a-zo-na-wa, na ndo mbeni hoto so fade Mbi fa na mo.”​—Gen. 22:2-4.	It might be said that while God’s laws test our obedience, his principles test the depth of our spirituality and of our desire to please him.	330	For instance, imagine how Abraham must have felt as he made a three-day journey to Moriah in obedience to God’s command: “Take, please, your son, your only son whom you so love, Isaac, and make a trip to the land of Moriah and there offer him up as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall designate to you.”​—Gen. 22:2-4.	366
45:18; 55:10, 11). Même kusala so ayeke nzoni-kue so a yeke sara na Jéhovah na sese ge ayeke kaï tongana zo oko ayeke dä pëpe ti voro lo na yâ ti sedu ti kota temple ti lo ti yingo na sese.	They will not know that they are serving as God’s means for executing his righteous judgment against an unfaithful people.	559	(Isa. 45:18; 55:10, 11) Why, the rendering of sacred service to Jehovah would cease on earth if no humans were left to worship him in the earthly courtyards of his great spiritual temple!	749
Mawa ni ayeke so, ndali ti goro na aye mingi so letäa ahunda ti sara, kota mbage ti nginza so angorogbia, akota ndokua ti sese na azo amû asi lâ oko pëpe na azo so ayeke na bezoin ni.	Learning to Fear Jehovah	208	Unfortunately, because of corruption and bureaucratic red tape, a large part of the funds provided by governments, international agencies, and individuals never reaches the people who really need it.	684
(Psaume 34:21 [34:20, NW]; Zacharie 12:10; Jean 19:33-37) So ayeke gi ambeni tapande oko oko ti aprophétie ti Messie so aga tâ tene na ndo Jésus, so Nzapa apusu awasungo Bible ti sû ni.*	On one occasion, Jesus Christ spoke about the need to pray and “not to give up.”	42	(Psalm 34:20; Zechariah 12:10; John 19:33-37) These are but a few examples of Messianic prophecies applied to Jesus by divinely inspired Bible writers.*	514
Jésus atene lani na Nicodème: “Zo oko ade ama na yayu pëpe, gi Lo oko so alondo na yayu azu, Lo so ayeke Molenge Ti Zo.” (Jean 3:13). Lo ye ti tene nyen?	I had to try to return the money.”	263	What did Jesus mean when he told Nicodemus: “No man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man”?​—John 3:13.	632
Na nda ni, tarango tele pepe na lege ti yingo ayeke woko mabe kue so lo yeke peut-être na ni kozoni, na même a yeke fâ ni.	(John 12:31) Like wind that whips up dust and litter, “the spirit of the world” stirs up hurtful desires that corrode love and cater to the weaknesses of the flesh.​—Galatians 5:19-21.	21	The lack of spiritual exercise eventually weakens, even deadens, what faith he might once have had.	848
Jéhovah ayeke Nzapa so aleke yâ ti aye nzoni, 15/5	Then he bound me with ropes and put me in a room with prisoners who had been caught with stolen goods in their possession.	144	Thomas Emlyn (scholar), 4/1	278
Ngoi na ngoi, mo bâ so ‘bê ti mo afâ’ na ‘yingo ti mo ayeke na vundu’?	Why does the expression “man of lawlessness” fit Christendom’s clergy?	978	Do you at times feel “broken at heart” and “crushed in spirit”?	955
Ye oko, azo kutu mingi so ayeke mbilimbili-kue pëpe angbâ be-ta-zo.	The man had a jug of cool water and offered me a drink.	833	Still, many millions of imperfect humans have succeeded in doing so.	920
(Ruth 1:9; aEphésien 3:14, 15) Amolenge nga ayeke pendere “ye ti héritier so L’Eternel [“Jéhovah,” NW] amu na zo,” ala ga na ngia na ababâ na mama so ayôro nzoni alengo ti Nzapa na yâ ala.	On one occasion, he said: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”	961	(Ruth 1:9; Ephesians 3:14, 15) Children too are a precious “inheritance from Jehovah,” bringing joy to parents who successfully instill godly qualities in them.	235
A yeke zingo ande azo so akui awe?	Follow the course of hospitality.”	11	Will the dead live again?	710
Na ahon ye so kue, i yü ndoye, so ayeke kamba so alingbi kue, so atingbi i.”​—aCol. 3:12-14.	Onlookers might agree.	124	But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.”​—Col. 3:12-14.	545
“[Kongregation, MN ] ayeke na siriri . . . na a kpengba.”​—KUSALA 9:31.	We lived on a small farm in eastern South Dakota.	239	“The congregation . . . entered into a period of peace, being built up.”​—ACTS 9:31.	448
Ti wara batême ‘na iri ti Babâ, ti Molenge, na ti yingo ti nzoni-kue’ aye ti tene nyen?	What circumstances in the first century helped the spread of the good news?	716	What does it mean to be baptized ‘in the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit’?	784
Na pekoni, lo gbe mbi na kamba na lo zia mbi na yâ ti chambre so a kanga azo ti nzi dä.	Like the apostles of old, we are for the most part unlettered and ordinary.	248	Then he bound me with ropes and put me in a room with prisoners who had been caught with stolen goods in their possession.	136
18 Tongana ti so e londo ti bâ, mbeni ita so akpengba na lege ti yingo alingbi ti mû maboko mingi na congrégation.	We will never know everything about the wisdom of God’s ways.	539	18 As noted, a mature Christian can be a powerful influence for good in the congregation.	115
Ala so amä na bê na amiracle ayeda na bê kue so amiracle asi biani, na peut-être ala si fani mingi.* Na tapande, na Grèce, a fa so na yâ ti angu so ahon, awamabe atene so amiracle asi peut-être fani oko na yâ ti nze.	Heartfelt, specific prayers can make a powerful impression on young minds.	659	Those who believe in miracles are convinced that they occur and perhaps occur often.* For example, it is reported that in Greece during the last few years, believers have claimed that miracles take place about once a month.	704
A yeke aTémoin ti Jéhovah si asigigi na ni.	Perhaps such points as these: (1) God expects justice to be exercised by those taking the lead among his people.	822	Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.	990
Lo tene: “Mapa so e fâ, e kamata ti sara beoko na tere ti Christ pëpe?	For more information, see chapter 17 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?	722	He said: “The loaf which we break, is it not a sharing in the body of the Christ?	303
Ndowa, nzara, nzara ti ngu nga na fungo ti ndo ni: zo alingbi ti fa pekoni pëpe.	Similarly, Trisha says: “We are both focused on not getting into debt, so we don’t fight about money.	920	The heat, hunger, and thirst​—not to mention the stench—​they had to endure defies description.	380
10 A sara angu mingi awe la mingi ti e aduti be-ta-zo na Jéhovah nga angbâ ti ku lâ ti Jéhovah kungo.	In his perfect wisdom, Jehovah God decided to allow the rebellion to proceed for a limited time.	552	10 Many of us have been keeping awake spiritually for decades.	317
Jésus abâ so mbeni ngangu asigigi na yâ tele ti lo, me lo bâ pëpe zo so ngangu ni asava lo.	Their sincere concern for his welfare​—their self-sacrificing love—​moved them to act swiftly in his behalf, opening the way for the jailer and his entire household to become believers.	98	Jesus felt power flow from him, but he did not see who had been cured.	272
6 Paul asû mbeti na Timothée, lo tene: “Mo ga mbeni tapande ndali ti azo so ayeke be-ta-zo, na lege ti tënë ti yanga ti mo, sarango ye ti mo, ndoye so mo yeke na ni, na lege ti mabe nga na dutingo so ayeke na sioni oko pëpe.”	Bible Can Help Marriage, 9/15	472	6 Paul wrote to Timothy: “Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”	568
Na lege so, na mbito pëpe e lingbi ti sala kusala na ziango bê so aita ti e na yâ vorongo ayeke na ni na mbage ti e, ti gi ye teti e mveni (1 Timothée 6:5).	(Acts 16:5) The 3,513 Witnesses in Albania still have much work to do.	995	We may deceive even ourselves, “thinking that godly devotion is a means of [material] gain.”	794
Kite ayeke pëpe so Jésus abâ lani na nene ni mingi mungo maboko so Marie amû na lo na yâ ti angu so aga na pekoni.	They are of fundamental importance and are likely among the first truths we learned when we began to study God’s Word.	361	Jesus no doubt cherished Mary’s support during the eventful years that followed.	711
Jonathan abâ lani lâ oko pëpe maseka David tongana mbeni wato ti lo	We have learned to rely on God through difficulties, and we feel that he has always helped and sustained our family.​—Psalm 55:22.	660	Jonathan never viewed the younger David as a rival	411
MO LINGBI TI SARA KUA SO?	How can one “fall” and yet have God’s favor?	62	CAN YOU HAVE A SHARE?	606
Na lege ti mbeni mandango Bible, ala wara “ndara ti sala kusala nga na ngangu ti gbu li nzoni” so ayeke mû maboko na ala ti ‘tambela na lege ti siriri’ na yâ angoi ti sioni so (aProverbe 3:21-23, NW ).	Do not let the distress this brings cause you to forget the joyful prospect of personally experiencing the resurrection and coming to life again with renewed health and vigor in the new world.	362	(Proverbs 3:21-23) Above all, they now entertain a hope “both sure and firm” for the future.	196
(Jean 4:24; aColossien 1:15; 1 Timothée 1:17) Tongaso, Jésus atene pepe so e azo e lingbi biani ti ba Jéhovah na lê ti e ti zo.	(Acts 8:38) Thus, the person being baptized is actually dipped under water.​—Matthew 3:16; Mark 1:10.	458	(John 4:24; Colossians 1:15; 1 Timothy 1:17) Hence, Jesus was not saying that we humans could actually see Jehovah with our physical eyes.	251
(Daniel 12:4; 2 Timothée 3:1) Juska laso, bungbi ti sinziri ni, aChrétien so asa yingo na ndo ti ala, Israël ti Nzapa, angbâ ti sala ye so ague legeoko na kusala ti sinziri ti prophétie, tongana ti so Isaïe afa: “A lingbi lo zia mê ti lo ti mä ndo nzoni.	Jehovah used Isaiah to convey a reassuring message.	802	(Daniel 12:4; 2 Timothy 3:1) Until this day, that watchman class​—anointed Christians, the Israel of God—​has been acting in harmony with Isaiah’s description of the prophetic watchman: “He paid strict attention, with much attentiveness.	0
(Apocalypse 18:21). So tâ kota ngia si ayeke duti ande na yayu tongana ye so asi, na ngoi so a futi abungbi ti vorongo nzapa ti wataka ti sese kue!​—Apocalypse 19:1, 2.	However, Jesus never desired such a future because it was not Jehovah’s will for him.	656	(Revelation 18:21) What heavenly rejoicing there will be when this happens, when the world empire of false religion is destroyed!​—Revelation 19:1, 2.	503

Tongaso, lo mû kozo dutingo ti lo ti sala na tënë na gbele azo ti kota da-ngbanga ti aJuif so asala ye lani na lege ti mbilimbili pëpe.	(Ecclesiastes 3:1, Moffatt) We all have the same amount of time at our disposal; it is up to us as to how we use it.	748	However, the greatest evidence that Paul did not compromise his faith is seen in his continuing to have Jehovah’s approval.	523

For instance, the apostle Paul urged his fellow Christian overseer Timothy: “Do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Timothy 4:5) Today, one way an overseer accomplishes his ministry is by being a zealous Kingdom proclaimer, one who shares regularly in the field ministry.	928	(Matthew 18:10) We enjoy angelic guidance and guardianship as Kingdom proclaimers and do not stumble spiritually.	449

Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one that baptizes in holy spirit.’	407	But of what value would that have been compared with the privilege of being a “man of the true God,” the mediator of the Law covenant, Jehovah’s prophet, and a Bible writer?	653
Me azo so alondo na ando nde nde so agi tâ tene aba so vorongo ayeke pepe gi tene ti ye so bê ti zo mveni aye.	But only the vigilant ones endured to the end. (Matt. 25:5, 6; 26:41) What about faithful anointed ones today?	706	But seekers of truth from many backgrounds have realized that worship is not a matter of preference.	689

Nathan ayeke mbeni zo so abâ ndo ayo, na lakue lo yeke leke ti tene aye ague na li ni.	Thus, Ecclesiastes 7:9 must mean that we should refrain from taking offense at the relatively minor sins of others.	522	Nathan was very progressive, always planning ahead for future growth.	124

The same may have been true of Daniel’s three companions, who were also given positions of authority.​—Dan. 2:49.	569	How knowing the truth helps you: Imagine how you would feel if you had trained for months to run a marathon and you had finished the race in first place, but then you were disqualified for unknowingly violating one of the rules.	269

Jéhovah atene na lo, atene: “A lingbi mo diko ni bï na lâ na gbe ti go, zia si lê ti mo akpengba ti sara ye alingbi na atënë kue so a sû na yâ ni.”	In Enoch’s case and ours, a good relationship with Jehovah requires more than just knowledge of God.	632	“You must read it in an undertone day and night,” he was told, “in order to observe carefully all that is written in it.”	403

2 Kete tene so a sû na li ti Psaume 90 atene so a yeke “mbeni sambela ti Moïse, zo ti Nzapa.”	Helping Peter and the others present to imagine the future, Jesus responded: “Truly I say to you, in the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.	551	2 The superscription of Psalm 90 calls it “a prayer of Moses, the man of the true God.”	377

(Ps. 55:2-5) Nevertheless, he did not allow anxiety to destroy his confidence in Jehovah.	498	(John 14:26) It would enable them to remember Jesus’ ministry and teachings, even his very words, and put these into writing.	329
Augustin, mbeni Babâ ti Eglise, so ake tënë ti Tertullien na ti Bible, atene so batême ayeke zi sioye ti kozo siokpari na amolenge so akui san ti wara batême fade ala gue na enfer.

Na mbeni ngoi ti ndowa, e bezoin nginza ti sara voyage ti gue na mbeni kota bungbi na mbeni ita-koli ayeda ti vo oto ti e ti mû lege na e ti gue.

True, Jesus had assured them that they would soon receive holy spirit.	41	3 To fight spiritual apathy, Christians need to have a clear view of who they are, and they must take reasonable pride in their distinct identity.	859

A yeke ngangu pëpe ti bâ faute so mbeni zo asara na ti tene sioni tënë ti lo (Psaume 64:3-5).	In this regard, historian H. G. Wells noted how remarkable it is that Jesus gave “enormous prominence . . . to the teaching of what he called the Kingdom of Heaven” and yet, said Wells, this teaching has “comparative insignificance in the . . . teaching of most of the Christian churches.”	711	(Psalm 64:2-4) On the other hand, keeping our speech positive requires skill.	956
Ni la, e yeke sala ye na ndara tongana e ba na nene ni mingi ye so a tene na ndo ti Zabolo.​—2 Timothée 3:14-17; 2 Pierre 1:20, 21.	Again I found that Jehovah cares for us and is truly “a father of fatherless boys and a judge of widows.”	189	We are wise, therefore, to take seriously what it says about the Devil.​—2 Timothy 3:14-17; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.	359
A yeke azo so andoye gi tere ti ala wani, azo ti baba, azo so ake yanga ti ababâ na amama ti ala, azo so ahinga ti kiri singila pëpe, azo so ayeke be-ta-zo pëpe, azo so ayeke asioni zo, azo so wuma ti ala ahon ndo ni nga na azo so andoye angia ahon ti ndoye Nzapa (2 Tim. 3:1-5).	(Ruth 1:9; Ephesians 3:14, 15) Children too are a precious “inheritance from Jehovah,” bringing joy to parents who successfully instill godly qualities in them.	139	(2 Tim. 3:1-5) So it can be a real challenge for you to maintain exemplary conduct despite being surrounded by this wicked environment.	437
Teti so David angbâ ti gi fango lege ti Nzapa, lo ngbâ lakue ti sara ye alingbi na ye so bê ti Jéhovah aye atâa so Abisaï awa lo ti fâ Saül.	On the other hand, a new father has new responsibilities to shoulder.	396	(1 Sam. 26:8-11) Because David kept seeking God’s guidance, he did not waver in his determination to act in accord with Jehovah’s will despite the urgings of Abishai.	562
Ti bata si bê ti e anze pëpe nga si ngangu ti e ahunzi pëpe, a lingbi e kpe ti duti na tele ti azo so ayeke bâ ye na nzoni lê pëpe nga ayeke ndulu ti bâ gi afaute ti azo na ti kasa ala.	“He Who Hates Bribes Will Live”	442	(Proverbs 27:3) To fight off feelings of discouragement and tiredness, we do well to avoid the company of those who dwell on negative thoughts and are prone to find fault and criticize others.	85
2:7, 8). Tongana a hunda ti tene ala mû wango, ye so ala ye ayeke ti sara ni na “ngangu pëpe”, même tongana ala yeke sara tënë na “azo so aye ti mä wango pëpe”. (2 Tim. 2:24, 25). A lingbi a-ancien asara nga tënë na nzoni bê na ngoi so ala wani ayeke sû mbeni mbeti ti tokua na mbeni bungbi ti a-ancien nde wala na filiale.	As a result, I felt loved and was not jealous of the time he spent serving the congregation.”	94	(1 Thess. 2:7, 8) When elders are called upon to give counsel, their goal is to do so “with mildness,” even when speaking with those “not favorably disposed.” (2 Tim. 2:24, 25) Elders should also be gracious in expressing themselves in written correspondence when it is necessary to correspond with another body of elders or with the branch office.	121

To prevent such an outcome, the same proverb states: “The rod and reproof are what give wisdom.” (Proverbs 29:15) At times, children may question the right of parents to reprove them.	760	Think, too, of the course Amnon took and the terrible outcome of his behavior.	394
13 Fade lumière ti Jéhovah ayeke ngbâ lakue ti su na ndo azo ti lo?	But they are filled with trouble and sorrow; they quickly pass by, and away we fly.”​—Psalm 90:10.	415	13. Why can we be sure that Jehovah’s light will never cease to shine upon his people?	978
Ti lingbi na atënë ti Paul, bê ti atâ Chrétien ayeke na ngia pëpe gi ti gue na abungbi ti vorongo fani oko na yâ yenga oko oko.	You likely know what is included in the fruitage of God’s spirit: love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.	929	They give of their time, energy, and resources to promote pure worship.	94
Nga, akiringo tënë so ambeni zo amû alingbi ti dabe mo na mbeni versê ti Bible wala mbeni tënë so alingbi ti mû ngangu na tënë so ala fa.	11 Paul loved Jehovah and desired his approval more than riches and prominence among men.	355	Also, comments made by others may remind you of a scripture or of a point that can build on the thought just expressed.	293
Na yâ ti versê so, David afa tongana nyen si tele ti ala anzere, ala wara ngangu nga ala duti nzoni.	If we put forth needed effort to resist them and rely on God to sustain us, we can maintain our integrity.	832	Likely, on their own, the sheep would not find a refreshing spot to lie down in peace.	791
Wâ ti mbi ti laso ayeke tongana nyen tongana mbi haka ni na ti so mbi yeke na ni lani teti Jéhovah, teti tâ tënë nga teti kusala ti lo na ngoi so mbi wara batême?	We will consider three important aspects of speech: when to speak, what to speak, and how to speak.	250	How does my zeal for Jehovah, his truth, and his work compare to the zeal I had when I was baptized?	889
Tongana abazengele ti ngoi ti giriri, mingi na popo ti e ayeke azo so ahinga mbeti pëpe nga asenge zo.	Would that have meant that eating human flesh was not really wrong?	220	Like the apostles of old, we are for the most part unlettered and ordinary.	144
Ngbanga ti nyen?	We also have to be careful about news or experiences of a spiritual nature that we receive secondhand.	953	Why?	75

Bible atene so akoli so a hiri ala awandara “alondo na mbage ti Tö”, na a yeke kâ si ala mä tënë ti dungo Jésus (Matthieu 2:1, 2, 9, Buku ti Nzapa Fini Mbuki). E lingbi ti tene so voyage ti akoli so ti gue juska na Judée aninga lani mingi.	(John 4:24; Colossians 1:15; 1 Timothy 1:17) Hence, Jesus was not saying that we humans could actually see Jehovah with our physical eyes.	158	According to the Bible, the so-called wise men were “from eastern parts,” and it was there that they had learned about Jesus’ birth. (Matthew 2:1, 2, 9) It must have taken a long time for these men to travel to Judea.	452
Bible atene Abraham ayeke “babâ ti ala kue so ayeke na mabe” ndali ti so lo dö aye mingi lo zia ndali ti Jéhovah (aRom.	Indeed, we are assured: “He is not far off from each one of us.”	557	In conjunction with all the sacrifices that Abraham was willing to make for true worship, he was fittingly called “the father of all those having faith.”	372
Tongana mbi fa na lo ndani awe, lo fa na mbi ambeni versê ti Bible so afa tënë ti zingongo ti akuâ.	Do the Hebrew Scriptures address this complex problem?	64	He began to talk about the Bible’s hope of a resurrection.	457

Biani, a yeke kota ye mingi ti tene e gi ti nzere na lê ti Jéhovah!	Before making a dedication to Jehovah, many of us had to make significant changes so that our dedication would be meaningful, acceptable to God.	440	The psalmist assures us that ‘favor is what God gives.’	27
Na lango 11 ti novembre 1918, Kozo Bira so Amû Sese Kue ahunzi.	He described the events that would lead up to his coming as Judge, and then he warned: “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.	365	On November 11, 1918, World War I came to an end.	299
Tongana ti so ngu ayeke woko yâ ti sese, ti diko Bible lâ na lâ nga ti gbu li na ndo ni alingbi ti mû maboko na e ti duti tongana sese so awoko na yâ ti maboko ti Jéhovah.	(Ecclesiastes 1:7) Only Jehovah, the God of infinite wisdom and loving care, could set such a cycle in motion.	972	As water softens clay, daily Bible reading and meditation can help us be malleable in Jehovah’s hands. Jehovah required that the kings of Israel write for themselves a copy of God’s Law and read it daily.	841
Oko pëpe!	11 For the sake of comparison, let us say that years ago some Witnesses or our Christian parents shared the Kingdom news with us.	443	How much less will the Universal Sovereign accept defective offerings!	446
(Diko Matthieu 28:19, 20.)	12, 13. (a) What lies has Satan promoted, and what is the truth regarding each of those lies? (b) How can we avoid being misled by Satan’s false stories?	473	(Read Matthew 28:19, 20.)	410

A lingbi mbi gi lege ti kiri na nginza ni.”	[Blurb on page 6]	930	I had to try to return the money.”	134
15 Tara gï ti gbu li ti mo.	Still, I saw no spiritual change in my husband.	121	15 Can you imagine a world without warfare, sickness, or death?	876
E lingbi ti fa na lo so abungbi ayeke mbage ti vorongo ti e nga e fa na lo aye ti nzoni so e wani e wara na pekoni.	The sister explained that it was right to pay for the ticket, even for just one stop.	720	We might mention that congregation meetings are part of our worship and show that they benefit us personally.	778

Ti mbage ti Mbeti ti Nzapa so a sû ni na yanga ti Hébreu, a sigigi na ni yeke yeke na ambage oku, na a to nda ni ngu 1953.	After my father died, I was able to get a secure job with the ministry of finance.	469	The Hebrew Scriptures in English came in five volumes, released progressively beginning in 1953.	800
Tongana e sû atënë ni so na mbeti, a yeke ngbâ na li ti e nga ayeke gbu bê ti e.	To them, witchcraft lives only in the realm of the imagination​—old hags dressed in hooded cloaks who add bats’ wings to a bubbling caldron, turn people into frogs, and soar through the night sky on broomsticks as they cackle maliciously.	636	Why else would Jehovah command the kings of Israel to make a personal written copy of the Law?	498
Na salango kusala na “nzara ti mitele, nzara ti lê, na fandara ti fini” ti handa na azo, Satan agi ti bata ala yongoro na Jéhovah wala ti gue na ala ti ke Lo (1 Jean 2:16).	How knowing the truth helps you: Imagine how you would feel if you had trained for months to run a marathon and you had finished the race in first place, but then you were disqualified for unknowingly violating one of the rules.	183	Using “the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life” to tempt people, he seeks either to keep or to entice them away from Jehovah.	587
A mû na lo mbeni kua so ade a mû mara ni na mbeni zo lâ oko ape.	SONGS: 63, 43	16	No other human has ever received a comparable assignment.	559

Kozoni, zia e bâ ambeni tënë na ndo ti mbaï ti Ephèse.	Jesus felt power flow from him, but he did not see who had been cured.	151	First, some background.	13
Na angoi so, mbi bâ tâ polele yingo ti Jéhovah na salango kusala.	There would be no way to pass on the family name and legacy.	890	On these occasions, I saw clear evidence of Jehovah’s spirit in operation.	290
Lo tene: “Mo lingbi ti gue.”	What a privilege that is!	992	He said, “You are free to go.”	540
Na lekengo atënë so, Jéhovah ayeke fa na gigi mbeni pendere sarango ye ti lo so ayeke be-nze-pepe, so atia azo mingi.	After ten years of work by six teams of researchers, the gene linked to Huntington’s disease was isolated, although the researchers have no idea how the gene causes the disease.	128	In settling these issues, Jehovah displays a particularly appealing quality, a quality that many today lack​—patience.	973
Molenge ti lo ti koli so aga kota zo awe andoye ândö Jéhovah.	PAGE 23 • SONGS: 111, 109	807	Later in life, however, he unrepentantly chose to practice lawlessness.	599

(Ésaïe 41:10, 13). A nzere na e pëpe ti bâ so Nzapa ayeke na nzara ti gbu maboko ti e?	(Matt. 24:45) Such provisions protect us spiritually and help us to stay close to God.​—Jas. 4:8.	402	(Isaiah 41:10, 13) How comforting to think that God figuratively wants to take us by the hand!	834
(Diko Job 31:6.)	They are a loving gift from him.	74	(Read Job 31:6.)	992
Na pekoni so ala sala kua ngangu teti angu 30 na ndo ni, ala hunzi na nda ni ti sû peko ti Bible kue na yanga ti Tahitien.	Small wonder, therefore, that the German newsmagazine FOCUS compared the world’s major religions​—Buddhism, Christendom, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism—​to gunpowder.	797	After having toiled for more than 30 years, they finally completed a translation of the entire Bible into Tahitian.	804
6 Ye ti dongo bê so asi peut-être na ndo mbeni oko ti ali ti Hoto ti Hermôn, na ndo so Jésus na abazengele ota alango dä na bï.

A yeke mbeni futa so ayeke kota ye ti sara ngangu ti wara ni.	2 Some 18 months earlier, in his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus had provided his disciples with a model upon which to base their prayers.	513	That is surely a prize worth striving for.	468
Ronald atene nda ni ayeke so “ndia ti ndo ni ahunda ti tene a zia na tele ti ada kue gi mara ti peinture oko.”	Each Christian is being given the opportunity to demonstrate that he can be used by the King, Christ Jesus.	378	Because “the law requires that all homes are painted the same color,” says Ron.	398
5:18, 19​—Naaman ayeke hunda ti tene a pardone lo ndali ti so lo yeke mû mbage na vorongo nzapa ti wataka?	Don’s tender affection had touched their hearts.	502	5:18, 19​—Was Naaman requesting forgiveness for having to participate in a religious act?	964

When you need counsel, they offer it in love.	631	11 Regardless of how the title “Christ” is used with reference to Jesus, it highlights this important truth: Even though the Son of God came to the earth as a man and made his Father’s will known, he was neither just an ordinary man nor merely a prophet; he came to be the Anointed One of Jehovah.	1
Na pekoni, ala sara na lo thé na ala ngbâ asara lisoro na lo.	‘You Are Worthy to Receive Worship’	704	“Hats off to these Witnesses,” he wrote.	811

Traditionally, we had been part of a matrilineal system, in which children were considered part of the mother’s family.	558	(Acts 24:15) They will need to learn about Jesus’ ransom sacrifice; more than that, they must be taught to exercise faith in that sacrifice in order to receive its benefits.	954

Versê ni atene: “Lege ti azo ti mbilimbili ayeke tongana lâ ti ndapre so asu, a su mingi, juska a ga kota lâ.”	God’s purpose was delayed when humans rebelled against his rule.	589	That means that our conduct and our understanding of God’s purposes will improve over time.	660

Wungo ti ala aga nduru na kutu mbasambala, ala yeke na yâ ti akodoro 235 tongaso nga ala yeke na yâ ti akongregation 100 000 tongaso.	If I find myself in a situation where changes seem hard to accept, I reflect on Peter’s words to Jesus: ‘Lord, whom shall we go away to?	295	They are already nearly seven million strong, in at least 235 lands and in some 100,000 congregations.	241
Kete molenge-wali so ti Israël ayeke lani na mabe so Nzapa alingbi ti sala amiracle.	How did Jehovah answer their prayers?	734	The little Israelite girl had faith in God’s ability to perform miracles.	935
Luc, mbeni wasungo mbaï ti ngoi ni kâ so ayeke gi nda ti aye nzoni, atene Messie ni aga lani na yâ ti “ngu bale-oko na ndo ni oku ni so Tibère César akomande”. (Luc 3:1-3). Ngu 15 ni so Tibère akomande ato nda ni na nze ti septembre ti ngu 28 na ahunzi na nze ti septembre ti ngu 29.	The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.”	657	(Luke 3:1-3) That 15th year of Tiberius’ reign began in September of 28 C.E. and ended in September of 29 C.E. Luke further states that the Jews at this time “were in expectation” of the Messiah’s arrival.	998
Ye oko, lo zia pëpe si gingo bê asara si lo zia bê ti lo na Jéhovah encore ape.	Why else would Jehovah command the kings of Israel to make a personal written copy of the Law?	268	(Ps. 55:2-5) Nevertheless, he did not allow anxiety to destroy his confidence in Jehovah.	198
Zo so asara terê ti lo kete ayeke sara ye tongana nyen?	Before long he was a drug addict, robbing people to pay for his vice.	347	How is modesty related to humility?	700
Na bango koli na wali so aga mbakoro awe me so ala mû fini ti ala kue ti sara na Jéhovah, apusu Tony na Wendy ti zia na ala ndo ti lango.	Madge’s counsel steered me through many dark moments.	643	Seeing that the elderly couple had given their entire lives to Jehovah, Tony and Wendy were moved to take them in.	887
5 Paul, Silas na Timothée azia gbata ti Lystre so ayeke na Mbongo ti Galatie.	Why must our commendation be sincere?	360	5 Paul, Silas, and Timothy had left the city of Lystra in southern Galatia.	686
Yengo tele ti aita so Don ayeke na ni andu bê ti ala mingi.	[Footnote]	6	Don’s tender affection had touched their hearts.	287
A mû tënë so na peko ti mbeni gingo nda ti ye so a sala na yâ kodoro ti Amerika kue.	(Revelation 18:21) What heavenly rejoicing there will be when this happens, when the world empire of false religion is destroyed!​—Revelation 19:1, 2.	160	This headline in the newsletter Emerging Trends summarized the results of a nationwide poll in the United States.	962
Tongaso mbi sara ngangu ti mbi kue ti fa nzo tënë.	19 Are you heeding Jesus’ advice to keep your eye “simple”?	335	So I decided to do my best to spread the good news.	407
Nga, mbeni zo alingbi ti hinga atënë ti bê ti mba ti lo atâa mba ti lo ni asara tënë pëpe (aProv.	(Read.)	514	And much may be learned from what is not said.	569
Ala zia bê ti ala kue na Jéhovah na lo iri tënë nzoni na ndo ti ala.	Contacting them or submitting to their influence is not to be taken lightly, for they, just like their leader, Satan the Devil, would like to devour us.	32	They trusted in Jehovah. Were they blessed? Absolutely!	102
Lo yeda.	However, motivated by our desire to serve Jehovah wherever we could be used best, we tackled this new assignment, with his blessing.	23	Would she like to come with me?	374
Tongaso “sese ti fini” ti mbilimbili so a ze na e ayeke bungbi ti azo so Nzapa ayeda na ala.	5 The ministry that Jehovah has entrusted to us is far too precious to be allowed to become commonplace.	225	God’s Word further promises that under the rule of Christ, those approved by God will receive the gift of everlasting life and will live a satisfying life in an earthly paradise.	578
A lingbi Komite so abâ lege ti fango tënë ti congrégation azia mo hio na yâ ti mbeni groupe ti fango tënë.	(Mark 12:31) Did Jesus place a limit on loving our neighbor based on where that neighbor lives or on what nationality he is?	605	The Congregation Service Committee should promptly assign you to a field service group.	780
Tongaso, Néhémie asara tënë na ala na ndo ti sioni tapande ti Salomon.	32 “My Dream Has Come True”	612	Although Solomon “was loved by his God, . . . the foreign wives caused even him to sin.”	73
Tongana mara ti ye tongaso asi na mo mbeni lâ, bâ ndo na mbage ti Jéhovah nga na azo ti lo ti mû maboko na mo tongaso si mo zia pëpe si mbeni zo anzi futa ti mo.​—Diko Psaume 34:18; aProverbe 13:20.	So in November 1990, I began serving in Béziers as a pioneer.​—Psalm 94:17-19.	526	If that ever happens to you, turn to Jehovah and his people for help so as not to allow yourself to be deprived of the prize.​—Read Psalm 34:18; Proverbs 13:20.	88
Na ngu 1876, Charles Taze Russell asû article so atene: “Angoi ti Amara Ayeke Hunzi Lawa?”	• What special relationship with Jehovah did the ancient Israelites have?	809	In 1876, an article written by Charles Taze Russell was published in the magazine Bible Examiner.	719
Peut-être disciple ni so ayeke lani dä pëpe. Ni la, Jésus akiri afa na nzobe angbongboro tënë ti sambela so.	But it is not bribery to give a tip or a gift to a public servant when he performs his duty or to obtain a legitimate service or to avoid unfair treatment.​—4/1, page 29.	520	2 Some 18 months earlier, in his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus had provided his disciples with a model upon which to base their prayers.	285
(Diko.)	(Psalm 34:20; Zechariah 12:10; John 19:33-37) These are but a few examples of Messianic prophecies applied to Jesus by divinely inspired Bible writers.*	133	(Read.)	505
Ye oko, ngoi kete na pekoni, Miriam ato nda ti duti na gingo bê so ayeke na lege ni pëpe; lo pensé so mbeni mbage ti kota ndo so a mû na lo ayeke kiri ande na wali ti Moïse, so lo bâ lo tongana wali so aye ti mû place ti lo.	We therefore appreciate it when others respect our time, showing reasonableness when they approach us and in the amount of our time that they take.	914	Now, though, Miriam might have become unduly concerned about losing some of her prominence to a suspected rival, the wife of Moses.	656
Atâa so ala yeke lani na yâ ti dunia so li ti azo ni ayeke gi na ndo ti gigi ti ala wani, Noé na sewa ti lo angbâ gi na yâ ti kua ti lekengo arche ni, même si azo ni abâ ni na nene ni ape wala ala tene ye asara li ti ala.	In the same way, when preaching the Kingdom message, caring publishers give support to all responsive ones who are suffering in some way.	639	Even though they lived in a world that was geared toward making their primary pursuit in life, building the ark, seem trivial, misguided, or foolish, they still kept at it faithfully.	628
Atâa so wungo ti ala ayeke lani 10000 tongaso, mbeni kota tara ayeke ku ala na lango ni so.	Rather than risking that outcome, we might forgo the opportunity to conduct a study.	388	Though they were 10,000 strong, their faith and courage would face a great test this day.	895
Tongana e yeke na mara ti songo tongaso na mbage ti Nzapa, fade e yeke hunda lâ oko pëpe tënë so: ‘Fade mbi yeke ngbâ ti sala na Jéhovah na yâ angu so ayeke ga?’	In preaching to these Greek-speaking people, Paul often quoted or paraphrased portions of that translation.​—Genesis 22:18, footnote; Galatians 3:8.	753	If we have such a relationship with God, we will never ask, ‘Will I still be serving Jehovah in a few years’ time?’	922
Lo mû ambeni tongana abazengele, ambeni tongana aprophète, ambeni tongana awafango nzo tënë, ambeni tongana aberger na awafango ye, si ala kiri na azo ti be-vulu na nzoni lege, si ala sara na azo, si tere ti Christ akpengba.”​—aEphésien 4:8, 11, 12, NW.	Jesus’ words bring to mind what King David of ancient Israel was inspired to write centuries earlier: “The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”​—Psalm 37:11, KJ.	541	He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the readjustment of the holy ones, for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ.”​—Ephesians 4:8, 11, 12.	758
Me a yeke petengo goro pëpe ti mû nginza wala matabisi na mbeni wakua ti letäa teti salango kua ti lo, wala ti wara na mbeni ye so ndia ayeda na ni wala ti tene a sala mbeni ye ti kirikiri na mo pëpe.​—1/4, lembeti 29.	Likewise, it is not right for us to allow personal pursuits or time-consuming distractions to prevent us from having a full share in the ministry.	494	But it is not bribery to give a tip or a gift to a public servant when he performs his duty or to obtain a legitimate service or to avoid unfair treatment.​—4/1, page 29.	513
Zia e bâ tongana nyen la tongana mo sara tongaso mo yeke bâ polele so Jéhovah la asara e nga so Bible ayeke tënë ti yanga ti lo.—aHéb. 11:1.	Jonah came to have Jehovah’s view of the repentant Ninevites	613	(Matt. 13:23) Let us see how doing so can help you to strengthen your faith in God as the Creator and in the Bible​—topics on which there is no shortage of “convincing evidence.”​—Heb. 11:1, ftn.	353
Tongaso, Zo-ti-fa-tene 7:9 aye ti tene so a lingbi e duti ndulu ti sala ngonzo hio pëpe na gbele akete faute kue so amba ti e asala.	16 Humility and modesty help a married person focus on the strengths of his or her mate.	106	Thus, Ecclesiastes 7:9 must mean that we should refrain from taking offense at the relatively minor sins of others.	179
E lingbi ti gbu nda ti ye so na bango nzoni chapitre 6 ti Marc.	However, the greatest evidence that Paul did not compromise his faith is seen in his continuing to have Jehovah’s approval.	163	We can gain insight into this by a careful consideration of Mark chapter 6.	818
Peut-être mo sara mbeto ti ye so azo ayeke tënë ande na ndo ti mo. Wala peut-être mo ye ti tene azo ahinga mo mingi wala mo ye ti wara gbâ ti nginza.	Our spiritual vision can become blurred, or out of focus, so that we fail to discern his crafty acts.	60	Maybe you detected a fear of man, a longing for prominence or luxury, or even an inclination toward stubbornness or independence.	428
Na pekoni, a sa yingo nga na ndo ti adisciple ti Jésus, na yingo vulu asara si ala ga amolenge ti Nzapa.	“I go online only while others are around”	848	Later, followers of Jesus were also anointed and begotten by holy spirit.	855
Tongaso, na novembre ti ngu 1990, mbi ga pionnier na mbi yeke fa lani tënë na gbata ti Béziers, na France.​—Psaume 94:17-19.	So after much prayer, I decided that I should stay to help care for Joan.	115	So in November 1990, I began serving in Béziers as a pioneer.​—Psalm 94:17-19.	511
Bazengele Paul ayeda na tënë so lo tënë: “Na lê ti e Nzapa ayeke gi oko, Babâ mveni, Lo so ye kue alondo na Lo, na e yeke ti Lo.” (1 aCorinthien 8:6; Esaïe 42:8).	Susan is a strong, spiritual woman.	170	The apostle Paul acknowledged: “There is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are.” (1 Corinthians 8:6; Isaiah 42:8) Another reason that Jehovah is “the true one” referred to at 1 John 5:20 is that he is the Source of truth.	928
Na pekoni, lo mû bio ti ngbangba ti lele na lo fâ azo saki oko na ni.​—aJuge 15:10-15.	● “He was an ordinary man who lived an extraordinary life.”	431	He then picked up the jawbone of an ass and struck down a thousand foes with it.​—Judges 15:10-15.	933
Bebungbi atokua ambeni ita na lettre ni na acongrégation.	(2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11) Unlike them, he could point to proof of his apostleship​—to imprisonment, beatings, perilous journeys, other dangers, hunger, thirst, and sleepless nights, as well as deep concern for fellow believers.	489	Representatives of the governing body were sent out to the congregations to deliver the letter.	793
(Bâ paragraphe 20)	THROUGHOUT the Bible, we find statements indicating that Jehovah wants us not only to live but also to enjoy life.	394	(See paragraph 20)	34
Azo so ayeke ku na dongo tele fango ngbanga ti Nzapa na ndo azo ti sioni, na peut-être a yeke na ala si amu atene so: “‘Tongaso i ngbâ ti ku mbi,’ so ayeke tene ti Jéhovah, ‘juska na la ni so fade mbi londo ti gbu ye ti pekoni, teti ye so mbi leke ti fâ na ngbanga ayeke ti bungbi amara, si mbi bungbi oko aroyaume, ti tuku kota ngonzo ti mbi na ndo ti ala, ngonzo ti wâ ti mbi kue; teti fade sese kue afuti na lege ti wâ ti mbanda ti mbi.’”​—Tsephania 3:8, NW.	(Nehemiah 8:8) All our meetings begin and end with prayer, and at most of them, we sing songs of praise to Jehovah.	278	They looked forward to the execution of divine judgment against the wicked and apparently were those addressed with the words: “‘Keep yourselves in expectation of me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘till the day of my rising up to the booty, for my judicial decision is to gather nations, for me to collect together kingdoms, in order to pour out upon them my denunciation, all my burning anger; for by the fire of my zeal all the earth will be devoured.’”​—Zephaniah 3:8.	26
Kete wungo ti azo so Nzapa mveni asala lani kusala na ala ti sala lisoro na mbeni bungbi, so azo ti yâ ni ala yeke ndulu mingi na mba, ayeke azo tongana Noé, Moïse, Jésus nga na ambeni zo nde.	Also, serving “shoulder to shoulder” in the ministry produces a united spirit in the congregation.​—Read Zephaniah 3:9.	579	The few individuals with whom God had dealings personally​—Noah, Moses, Jesus, and others—​were, in fact, used by Him to communicate with a closely associated group.	647
Tënë so kamême akpa mbeni ye so ayeke na lege ni, na mbi komanse ti gue na bungbi ti ala.	Yes, nothing is wasted as these silent workers prepare the soil for new growth.	409	This sounded more reasonable, and I started attending their religious meetings.	824
Na lege so, tongana a yeke aturugu ti temple ti aJuif, me pepe Lysias, si agbu fade Paul, ka Sanhédrin alingbi ti ga na lo na ngbanga na ti fâ ngbanga ti lo sân tene.	(Isaiah 11:9) Jesus will have eliminated the cause of poverty.	410	So had Paul been arrested by the Jewish temple police instead of by Lysias, the Sanhedrin could have tried and sentenced him without a problem.	435
Ala zia lege ni pëpe	Missionary service is not about you.	592	They Do Not Give Up 8.	586
“Zo so aga nduru na Nzapa a lingbi lo mä na bê so Nzapa ayeke dä na lo ga zo ti futango azo so ayeke gi lo ngangu.”​—A-HÉBREU 11:6	What is God’s will for the “great crowd”?	745	“He that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.”​—HEBREWS 11:6	917
4 Peut-être na ambeni ngoi na yâ ti fini ti mo, mo bâ so, tongana Paul, mo zia si yingo vulu ti Nzapa afa lege na mo, me na pekoni aye ni asi tongana ti so mo ku terê ti mo na ni ape.	9 Prove Bible truth to yourself. Our sense of identity as servants of Jehovah can weaken if it is not solidly based on knowledge of the Scriptures.	664	4 Perhaps there have been times in your life when you felt that you, like Paul, were following the leadings of God’s holy spirit, but then things did not turn out the way you expected.	5
(Kusala 2:24). Tongana e yeda so Nzapa ayeke dä na so lo la lo sara aye kue, e yeke yeda na bê ti e kue so ye oko akara lo lani pëpe ti zingo Molenge ti lo na kuâ.​—aHébreu 3:4.	He also related how Jehovah’s Witnesses have helped to inform doctors about bloodless treatment techniques.	932	(Acts 2:24) If we accept that there is a God and that he is the Creator of all things, then we have every reason to believe that he could raise his Son from the dead.​—Hebrews 3:4.	426
Ndara ti Nzapa amû lege na e biani ti manda aye so ayeke hunzi ka pëpe, na ye so amû ngia na e!	Her role is reflected in the way she communicates.	95	We will never know everything about the wisdom of God’s ways.	145
Na Psaume 26:4, David atene: “Mbi duti pëpe na azo ti handa, na mbi tambela pëpe na awandendia.”	He said, “You are free to go.”	274	According to Psalm 26:4, David sang: “I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in.”	80
Atënë ti Jésus so adabe e na ye so David, Gbia ti Israël ti giriri, asû na gbe ti yingo ti Nzapa a ninga mingi awe: “Azo so ayeke na tâ be-ti-molenge, fade sese ni aga ye ti héritier ti ala, fade ala wara ngia na yâ siriri so awu mingi.”​—Psaume 37:11.	Two days later, Paul sent me a copy of The Watchtower.	448	Jesus’ words bring to mind what King David of ancient Israel was inspired to write centuries earlier: “The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”​—Psalm 37:11, KJ.	519
Jéhovah asoro awe ngoi so lo yeke futi ande sioni dunia so, me zo oko ahinga pëpe ‘lango nga na ngbonga so’ futingo ni ayeke si na ni (Mat. 24:36). Laso, Nzapa ahunda na e ti gboto mê ti azo nga ti fa na ala tongana nyen ti sö kuâ.	Do you have a meaningful share in that work?	584	No human knows the “day and hour” when that will come. (Matt. 24:36) At this time, we have the God-given work of warning people and telling them how they can be saved.	715
A yeke aTémoin ti Jéhovah si asigigi na ni.	“Carry on with one another loving-kindness.”​—ZECHARIAH 7:9. 1, 2. (a) Why should we display loving-kindness? (b) What questions will we consider?	336	Published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.	668
Ngere so alingbi na nginza ti mbeni senge zo ti kua ti lango 25.	Do you not find this approach on Jehovah’s part heartwarming?	756	That was the equivalent of what an unskilled laborer might earn for 25 days’ work.	404
Nyongo vin ayeke lani sioni pëpe na lê ti Jésus.	But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.”​—Col. 3:12-14.	141	Drinking wine was obviously acceptable to Jesus.	100
A mû lege na e ti zia akpale ti e ti lango ni yongoro na ti zia li ti e gi na ndo ti aye so e lingbi ti sara ti kpengba songo ti e na Jéhovah.	In time, though, he made progress.	604	It’s a time for us to put the stress of daily life on hold and focus on our spirituality.	673
Tongana nyen la Jéhovah afa na azo ti lo ti bâ mawa ti zo?	LIFE STORY	651	How does Jehovah teach his people to manifest compassion?	763
Même asenge senge ye so azo mingi ahinga nga na aye so ayeke si lakue, ala pensé so mbeni tâ tënë so ndani alï [so ayeke ngangu na zo ti mä yâ ni] ayeke na yâ ni . . . , ala pensé même so wungo ti asusu so adisciple agbu na bï so a zingo Sauveur ti ala na kuâ na lo si na ala ayeke na lege ti fä.	(John 5:28, 29) What does that prospect do for the surviving mate?	97	Even the most simple and commonplace circumstance was thought to conceal within itself the most recondite [hidden] truth . . . , even in the number of fish caught by the disciples on the night the risen Saviour appeared to them​—how much some have tried to make of that number, 153!”	358
5 Ye oko, ngbâa be-ta-zo na ti ndara ahon lani na yâ a-oko tara legeoko na ‘ngbâa ti sioni so’.	They would likely wonder whether the God of their forefathers could deliver them.	789	5 Nonetheless, the faithful and discreet slave went through the same tests as “that evil slave.”	83
KITE ayeke dä pëpe so mo mä amara ti tënë tongaso awe.	Bearing Thorough Witness Today	436	YOU have likely heard similar stories.	458
Jésus amû maboko na Pierre nga na ambeni disciple so ayeke dä na ngoi ni so ti bâ na yâ ti li ti ala gigi ti kekereke, lo tene: “Ti tâ tënë ni, mbi tene na ala: Na ngoi so a yeke kiri ti leke aye kue ti ga fini, tongana Molenge ti zo ayeke duti na ndo ti trône ti lo ti gloire, ala so amû peko ti mbi, fade ala nga kue ayeke duti na ndo ti atrône bale-oko na use, na ala yeke fâ ngbanga ti akete mara bale-oko na use ti Israël.	(Acts 2:15; 1 Thessalonians 5:7) Hence, both the groom and the trustworthy Christian he designates as director of the feast ought to make sure that all present follow the clear directive: “Do not be getting drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery.”​—Ephesians 5:18; Proverbs 20:1; Hosea 4:11.	744	Helping Peter and the others present to imagine the future, Jesus responded: “Truly I say to you, in the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.	191
Na yâ ndara ti lo so ayeke mbilimbili-kue, Jéhovah Nzapa amû desizion ti zia lege na kengo yanga teti kete ngoi.	“Love is envy’s great enemy,” says sociologist Francesco Alberoni.	368	In his perfect wisdom, Jehovah God decided to allow the rebellion to proceed for a limited time.	150
A yengi ngangu, tere ni asuru na a kungbi, a tuku na sese.	He may also be less inhibited in expressing perverse thoughts and desires that are normally suppressed.	695	It shook, it cracked, and then it fell​—crashing to the ground!	239
Ngbanga ti nyen zingongo akuâ ayeke mû gonda na iri ti Jéhovah?	You can also start a research project.	580	Why will the resurrection glorify Jehovah’s name?	438
Ngbanga ti nyen?	Perhaps a doctor or a nurse said them before administering a recommended treatment.	178	Why is that?	33
Matabisi ni ayeke ti fa kua na aita. Tongana a-ancien so amû maboko na aita ti congrégation ni ti ga aberger na lege ti yingo, congrégation ni kue ayeke wara ande ye ti nzoni na pekoni même tongana a-ancien so amû maboko na aita ni ahon na mbeni congrégation nde.	(Col. 1:15) Even before coming to earth, Jesus chose to remain loyal to his Father and not join Satan in his rebellion.	102	When such elders help the local brothers to become spiritual shepherds, the entire congregation will continue to benefit from the work of “need greaters” even after they move away to another congregation.	305
Biani, e yeke na beku so: “Lo yeke yongoro pëpe na e oko oko kue.”	We do well to heed the words of the apostle Peter, who urged fellow believers: “Honor men of all sorts, have love for the whole association of brothers.”​—1 Pet. 2:17.	903	Indeed, we are assured: “He is not far off from each one of us.”	252
Na yâ ti ngobo ti e aTulu, amolenge ayeke ti yâ ti sewa ti mama ni me ti babâ ni pëpe.	It reads: “God himself will be with them.	911	Traditionally, we had been part of a matrilineal system, in which children were considered part of the mother’s family.	307
Ala yeke hinga ande pepe so ala yeke ye so Nzapa asala na kusala ti fâ ngbanga ti mbilimbili ti lo na ndo ti azo so aduti be-ta-zo pepe.	No other human has ever received a comparable assignment.	270	They will not know that they are serving as God’s means for executing his righteous judgment against an unfaithful people.	131
(Luc 4:16) Ti Joe, mbeni ancien so ayeke na kota sewa, na so ayeke sala kusala teti angbonga mingi, salango ye ti lâ oko oko amu maboko ti lë na yâ lo bezoin na nzala ti gue lakue na abungbi.	“IF YOU put forth sincere effort and show that you want your marriage to succeed, you can enjoy Jehovah’s blessing,” says a husband who has been happily married for 38 years.	303	(Luke 4:16) For Joe, an elder with a large family who works long hours, habit has helped to create in him a need and a desire to attend meetings regularly.	609
Teti e yeke na mabe na yâ tene ti prophétie ti Nzapa, e hinga na bê kue so e lï mingi awe na yâ “lâ ti nda ni.”	A needy Christian should not be too proud to accept the loving assistance of fellow believers or any governmental aid he or she may qualify for.	904	Because we have faith in God’s prophetic word, we are convinced that we are now deep in “the time of the end.”	579
Me mungo ngoi mingi teti kua ti fango tënë asala pëpe si ala yeke bâ tele ti ala kota ahon tanga ti aita ti ala.	(1 Sam. 26:8-11) Because David kept seeking God’s guidance, he did not waver in his determination to act in accord with Jehovah’s will despite the urgings of Abishai.	236	But the fact that they spend more time in the ministry does not make them feel superior to their brothers and sisters.	28
Tongana a yeke ndara si afa lege na atënë nga na asalango ye ti e, e yeke wara “mosoro na yango-iri” so ndara ayeke na ni (aProverbe 8:18).	Yes, empathy involves our feeling another person’s pain in our heart.	262	When our words and deeds are guided by wisdom, we have the “riches and glory” that exist with wisdom.	311
NA NDO TI COUVERTURE NI: Ambeni Témoin ti Jéhovah ayeke tambela na bateau ti gue ti fa tënë na azo so ayeke na yâ ti azoa ti Bocas del Toro Archipelago nduru na banga-do ti ngu ti Panama.	Seeing how well the people responded to the Kingdom message we shared with them gave me so much joy.	601	COVER: Faithful Witnesses use boats to reach some of the people living on islands of the Bocas del Toro Archipelago off the northwest coast of Panama.	881
Bâ tapande ti mbeni maseka-wali so ague na mbeni kete kodoro ti mû maboko na azo ni kâ ti hinga ye na ndo Tënë ti Nzapa.	Where God’s Law was definite, it meant what it said.	76	Consider a young girl who moved to a rural town to help people to learn about God’s Word.	471
Ka ti yingo-ti-hinga ti e ayeke tongana nyen?	Though space limits our discussing those reasons here, there are two facts that can give us hope and encouragement.	595	But what about our conscience?	37
Tongana zo ni abâ Bible na nene ni nga lo ye biani ti hinga atënë so ayeke na yâ ni, mara ti tënë tongaso alingbi ti pusu lo ti gi ti hinga ye mingi na ndo ti tënë ni.—Kus. 17:11.

But of what value would that have been compared with the privilege of being a “man of the true God,” the mediator of the Law covenant, Jehovah’s prophet, and a Bible writer?	171	(Hebrews 6:18, 19) Margaret, a spirit-anointed sister in her 90’s who was baptized over 70 years ago, admits: “When my husband was dying of cancer in 1963, I felt that it would be wonderful if the end came quickly.	762

“A yeke ti hinga so a yeke nzi na a yeke glisa biaku mosoro ti ngele ngangu ti mbeni zo, ngoi, mbeni mbage ti fini ti lo.”	There is only one way​—to use the Bible as a measuring stick.	4	“The knowledge that one’s most precious resource, time, a fraction of one’s life, is being stolen away, irrecoverably lost.”	860

Jesus no doubt cherished Mary’s support during the eventful years that followed.	154	In this regard, historian H. G.

Ti tene e duti na siriri nga e duti beoko, a lingbi e yeda so Nzapa la ayeke na droit ti komande e.	Not according to one recent poll in Britain.

Mungo tele ti e mveni ti sala na aita ti e ti koli na ti wali ayeke ga na e kota ngia (Kusala 20:35).	True, we have not seen God’s mighty acts as Joshua did, but if anyone should doubt, the Bible book bearing Joshua’s name provides eyewitness testimony to the trustworthiness of Jehovah’s word.	772	(Acts 20:35) Neither the joy of giving such help nor the uplift of receiving it comes to those who deliberately isolate themselves.	771
Atâa so lo yeke zo so asala ye nzoni, lo dema tele ti lo: “Na yâ ti yenga ni mo yeke na yanga-da pëpe, nga na dimanche mo yeke gue gi na abungbi ti mo!”	Given the immense scale of the universe, many people ask, ‘Why should the almighty Creator watch what lowly humans do on a tiny planet?’	649	Although he was generally good-natured, he complained, “You’re not here during the week, and on Sundays you go to your meetings!”	923

(The Battle for God​—Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam) But is it only the “fundamentalist” brand of religion that has failed this test and become “a theology of rage and hatred”?	943	5 For good reason, Jehovah gave Habakkuk this rousing commission: “Write down the vision, and set it out plainly upon tablets, in order that the one reading aloud from it may do so fluently.	571

If we are associated with a congregation like the one in ancient Smyrna, on what issue should our attention be focused? 16 What if we, whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, are associated with a congregation like the one in ancient Smyrna?	194	13 Regarding true worship and false, many Israelites in Elijah’s day were sitting on the fence.	36
Mbeni buku nde so afa polele nda ti Satan, zo so ayeke na gunda ti aye ti sioni, ayeke dä pëpe. Na ndo ni, mbeni buku ayeke dä pëpe so afa tongana nyen a yeke futi ande lo nga na asioni kusala ti lo kue.

Kozo article ni afa tongana nyen la mabe ti e alingbi ti kono nga ti ngbâ ti kpengba.	(Acts 20:35) Neither the joy of giving such help nor the uplift of receiving it comes to those who deliberately isolate themselves.	725	The first article shows how our faith can grow and remain strong.	66

(Jean 15:20). Me ti sara ye tongana ti so zo ni asara na e, e yeke wara ye ti nzoni na pekoni pëpe.	Those offering acceptable sacrifices to Jehovah receive his approval.	36	(John 15:20) But responding in kind to disparaging comments does not produce good results.	71

He Expressed Belief in His Disciples	754	(John 10:16; 1 Pet. 2:11) These articles will give us the answer and will strengthen us in our determination to remain such, unitedly preaching as part of an international brotherhood.	300
18 Na fango mbeni lengo nde so asala si bê ti e ayeda na fango lege ti Nzapa, Salomon atene: “Kpe mbito ti Jéhovah na zia lege ti sioni.” (aProverbe 3:7, NW) Na ndo Israël ti giriri, Jéhovah atene: “O! tongana bê ti ala ayeke tongaso ti kpe mbito ti Mbi! na ti bata komandema ti Mbi kue lakue, si ala na amolenge ti ala alingbi duti nzoni lakue!”	This article shows how Bible principles can be applied in order to settle differences with others.	397	18 Pointing to yet another quality that makes our heart receptive to divine guidance, Solomon stated: “Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad.” (Proverbs 3:7) Jehovah said concerning ancient Israel: “If only they would develop this heart of theirs to fear me and to keep all my commandments always, in order that it might go well with them and their sons to time indefinite!”	7

See The Watchtower, August 1, 1984, page 24.	428	We realize that should we die before Armageddon, a continued course of conduct displeasing to Jehovah could put us in the same position as those who have no prospect of a resurrection.	934
Na ndo ni kue, zia e sala ye alingbi na atënë ti wasungo psaume so: “Zia beku ti mo na L’Eternel!	We might mention that congregation meetings are part of our worship and show that they benefit us personally.	265	Let us wholeheartedly love our brothers, and may we always delight in the love that we receive from them.	487
Tongana e ga ndulu na Jéhovah, bê ti e ayeke pusu e biani ti mû ngoi ti e, ngangu ti e, nga na amosoro ti e teti kusala ti fango nzo tënë ti Royaume nga ti salango adisciple (Matthieu 28:19, 20).	ENJOY DOING WHAT YOU CAN	302	When we draw close to Jehovah, it is only natural that we want to use our time, energy, and resources to share as fully as possible in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. (Matthew 28:19, 20) At times, we may feel that we are accomplishing little.	582
E yeke gi araison ti sara songo na ala na tenengo so ala yeke na gbâ ti anzoni sarango ye?	The Congregation Service Committee should promptly assign you to a field service group.	509	Do we justify such association by saying that they have many good qualities?	590

Against all odds​—in subzero temperatures and without proper climbing equipment—​Shackleton and his companions reached their destination, and he eventually rescued all his stranded men.	26	These principles were a comfort to the psalmist, as they can be for God’s servants who are struggling to deal with the difficulties of modern life. 5.	127
13 Na ndo ni, Jésus afa so ndoye so lo yeke tapande ni ayeke kota mingi ahon ndoye so azo ayeke fa na popo ti ala (Jean 13:34, 35).	Central to that brotherhood is “the faithful and discreet slave” with its representative Governing Body, which issues a constant supply of spiritual food in the form of printed material and programs for meetings and assemblies.	738	13 Furthermore, Jesus explained that the love he exemplified went beyond the love people commonly show for one another.	792
aga na aye ti nzoni na e oko oko kue?	What does it mean to be baptized ‘in the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit’?	143	benefit us personally?	162

Tongaso, e yeke na bezoin ti ‘pardone mba na bê ti e kue’.—aÉph. 4:32.	Yet, Paul said: “God called us, not with allowance for uncleanness, but in connection with sanctification.	891	Again and again, the Scriptures tell us to “have mutual concern for one another,” to “have tender affection for one another,” to “keep comforting one another,” and to be “building one another up.” (1 Cor. 12:25; Rom. 12:10; 1 Thess. 4:18; 5:11) Jehovah knows that Christians are imperfect, and this may make it challenging to be united, so we need to work at “freely forgiving one another.”​—Eph. 4:32.	852
Mo Yeke Soro Ande Kota Yanga-ti-Komande ti Zo Wa?	Shepherds, Imitate the Greatest Shepherds	327	Whose Sovereignty Will You Choose?	31
6:8). Bango gbâ ti aita so adabe ti mbi na tënë so mbeni surveillant ti circonscription atene na mbi. Lo tene: “Sara kusala ti pionnier.	God here promises that death will be no more, which suggests that the children who might be born then will not have to face the prospect of growing up and then getting old​—ending in death.	676	(Isa. 6:8) This multitude of individuals echo the truthfulness of the words of the circuit overseer who long ago said to me: “Get right into the full-time ministry.	657
Pendere ti arc-en-ciel ni adoit ti ngbâ tâ gi na yâ ti li ti ala, na a yeke mbeni ye ti girisango ni lâ oko ape.​—Genèse 9:12-17.

Legeoko na tënë so, bazengele Paul afa tënë so: “A lingbi azo kue amä yanga ti azo so akomande ala; teti yanga-ti-komande kue alondo na Nzapa; na Nzapa azia azo ti komande na ndo ti ala.”​—aRomain 13:1; Tite 3:1.	13 Furthermore, Jesus explained that the love he exemplified went beyond the love people commonly show for one another.	783	(Mark 12:17) Similarly, the apostle Paul directed: “Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God.”​—Romans 13:1; Titus 3:1.	951
Na yâ akozo ngu osio ti kua ti pionnier ti lo, lo mû maboko na apendere osio ti ga aTémoin.	Representatives of the governing body were sent out to the congregations to deliver the letter.	529	He helped four young people to become Witnesses in his first four years of pioneering.	491
Ngbanga ti nyen? Ngbanga ti so Élisée abâ na nene ni mingi pasa so Nzapa amû na lo ti sara kua na Élie.	We may deceive even ourselves, “thinking that godly devotion is a means of [material] gain.”	153	Evidently because Elisha appreciated his God-given privilege of ministering to Elijah.	310
Ye oko, e nga kue e sala si Lo Ti Nduzu Ahon Kue aga ‘ndo ti duti ti e,’ ndo so e wara nzoni duti dä.	Finally, in 1919, God’s people were given life, spiritually speaking, and were settled in their new spiritual land.	974	However, we also make the Most High God ‘our dwelling,’ where we find safety.	638

About 1991, I realized after analyzing my situation that the best way to avoid giving in to self-pity was to keep busy in sharing the precious Kingdom good news with others.	877	Small wonder, therefore, that the German newsmagazine FOCUS compared the world’s major religions​—Buddhism, Christendom, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism—​to gunpowder.	283
Ti bâ sandaga ti Jésus na nene ni alingbi ti gue na zo ti wara fini ti lakue lakue.	Saved, Not by Works Alone, But by Undeserved Kindness	728	What indicates that the early Christians took God’s guidance about blood seriously?	865

Fango tënë ayeke lani kua so ayeke kota ahon atanga ni kue na lê ti ala (Kusala 5:28-32, 41, 42).	The Hebrew Scriptures in English came in five volumes, released progressively beginning in 1953.	267	(Acts 5:28-32, 41, 42) Jehovah’s Witnesses today endeavor to do so as well.	486
Caïphe abâ lani Jésus tongana mbeni sioni zo so ayeke bi wusuwusu na yâ ti kodoro.	4 What did that assignment mean for the Levites?	804	Caiaphas viewed Jesus as a dangerous rabble-rouser.	339
Oko pëpe, teti Jéhovah atokua Ésaïe ti dë bê ti ala.	3. Why should we obey the command to make disciples? 3 First, why should we obey the command to make disciples?	332	Jehovah used Isaiah to convey a reassuring message.	159
Ye oko, a yeke gi pëpe tënë ti kono nzara ti amolenge ti manda ye.	(1 Cor. 4:11) Nevertheless, we can have every confidence in Jesus’ wise advice: “Never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’	655	However, it is not just a matter of stimulating your children’s mental faculties.	167
4 Kusala so a mû na aLévite so aye ti tene nyen teti ala?	After having toiled for more than 30 years, they finally completed a translation of the entire Bible into Tahitian.	283	4 What did that assignment mean for the Levites?	801

5:33; Gen. 2:23, 24). Tongana ngoi ayeke hon songo so ala yeke na ni na mbage ti mba ayeke kpengba, nga ala yeke ye tere ngangu.	(John 4:24; 17:17) And the apostle Paul said that our salvation depends on our coming to “an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Timothy 2:4) So it is vital that our beliefs be based on accurate Bible truth.	377	(Eph. 5:33; Gen. 2:23, 24) Over time, the attachment a couple have to each other gains strength, as does their love for each other.	107

Laso, mbeni oko lege so mbeni surveillant ayeke sala na kusala ti lo ayeke ti duti mbeni wafango tënë ti Royaume so ayeke na wâ na so ayeke mû mbage lakue na fango tënë.	The apostle Paul acknowledged: “There is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are.” (1 Corinthians 8:6; Isaiah 42:8) Another reason that Jehovah is “the true one” referred to at 1 John 5:20 is that he is the Source of truth.	527	For instance, the apostle Paul urged his fellow Christian overseer Timothy: “Do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Timothy 4:5) Today, one way an overseer accomplishes his ministry is by being a zealous Kingdom proclaimer, one who shares regularly in the field ministry.	169

In his letter to the Galatians, Paul called such acts and traits “the works of the flesh.”	57	You likely know what is included in the fruitage of God’s spirit: love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.	244

14 Tâ tënë, akpale alingbi ti si tongana e lu ye na lege ti mitele ahon ti lu ye na lege ti yingo (aGalate 6:7, 8).	We realize that should we die before Armageddon, a continued course of conduct displeasing to Jehovah could put us in the same position as those who have no prospect of a resurrection.	777	Why should we not automatically equate suffering with improper conduct? 14 Granted, problems may arise if we sow according to the flesh rather than the spirit.	597

Ye oko, a yeke gi “alege ti vorongo so azo ni abata na ngangu tënë ti mabe ti ala” si atï na yâ tara so na amaï “tënë ti ngonzo na kengo tele”?	And the apostle Peter wrote: “You [anointed Christians] know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were delivered from your fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from your forefathers. But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.”​—1 Peter 1:18, 19.	91	(The Battle for God​—Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam) But is it only the “fundamentalist” brand of religion that has failed this test and become “a theology of rage and hatred”?	741
Lo tene na nda ni, lo tene: “Babâ ti mbi so ayeke na yayu ayeke sara na ala tongaso nga tongana ala oko oko kue apardone aita ti ala na bê ti ala kue pëpe.”	When we encounter an angry response in the Christian ministry, does this not often happen because the householder is misinformed about our beliefs or blinded by some misconception?	661	His conclusion was: “In like manner my heavenly Father will also deal with you if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts.”	485

E hinga nzoni awe kota kangbi so ayeke na popo ti tâ vorongo ti aChrétien na sese so ague yongoro na Nzapa.	“Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.”	973	(Acts 9:2; Ephesians 4:22-24) Christians “make sure of all things” and “hold fast to what is fine”! (1 Thessalonians 5:21) We have a clear understanding of the vast difference between Christianity and the world that is alienated from God.	858

(Mark 12:17) Similarly, the apostle Paul directed: “Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God.”​—Romans 13:1; Titus 3:1.	792	The misuse of alcohol is obviously not compatible with the Scriptural directive: “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear.”​—2 Corinthians 7:1.	430
