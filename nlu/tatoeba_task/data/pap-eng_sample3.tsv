E área trankil i pintoresko aki kisas a parse un lugá mas apropiá pa dediká tempu na plaser ku pa siña tokante apnegashon òf nenga bo mes.

Sin embargo, despues di esei Senakerib a bisa: “No laga bo Dios, den kende bo ta konfia, gaña bo, bisando: ‘Yerúsalèm lo no wòrdu entregá den man di rei di Asiria.’”	“The ladies seeing at the windows”​—the eyes coupled with the mental faculties by which we see—​become dim, if not completely dark.	3	However, he then said: “Do not let your God in whom you are trusting deceive you, saying: ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’”	237
