Many offers of help and well-meaning gifts have been received so ungraciously that the sincere giver may think, ‘That is the last time I’ll do that!’	676	(Ge 24 Verses 10, 11) When he saw the women coming closer, he knew that the crucial moment of his mission had arrived.	750

Tara ti bâ tënë ti bê ti David na ngoi so lo hinga ni! 4 Bê ti e adö pëpe ti bâ so Jéhovah ayeke bi bê ti lo mingi na e laso.	16 If a baptized youth is disfellowshipped, the congregation members are expected “to quit mixing in company with” him. (1 Corinthians 5:11; 2 John 10, 11) This may eventually help him to ‘come to his senses’ and return to God’s protective fold.	931	4 It is no less astonishing to contemplate the remarkable personal interest that Jehovah is showing in us today.	407

Therefore, parents do well to ask themselves: ‘What sort of associate am I?	512	(Psalm 118:1, 29) These may well have been the last words of praise that Jesus Christ sang with his faithful apostles on the night before his death in 33 C.E.—Matthew 26:30.	876
Ye oko, na ngia, ala ngbâ ti dabe ti ala na ndoye so Nzapa ayeke na ni na mbage ti ala nga na ndo kota nzobe ti lo.	Many people who have lost loved ones find comfort in the same Bible truths that brought comfort to Castro.	606	However, they still cherish fond memories of God’s love and undeserved kindness.	176
(Kus. 15:29).	Therefore, we may safely conclude that the first Christians could read God’s name both in their translations of the Hebrew Scriptures and in their copies of the Christian Greek Scriptures.	651	(Acts 15:29) The final words, a type of complimentary close, can also be rendered “be strong.”	725

Me a yeke mbeni ndoye so ayeke kota mingi so ayeke pusu zo ti fa so lo pensé na nzoni ti amba ti lo, même kozo na ti lo.	(Revelation 2:10) Thus, we say with confidence: “If God is for us, who will be against us?”​—Romans 8:31.	264	Rather, it is a superior form of love that causes a person to show sincere concern for the welfare of others, even putting them before self.	809
Confiance so Nzapa azia na Daniel ayeke na lege ni ape?	11. How has Satan used persecution to try to silence Christians? 11 A third tactic that the Devil uses in an attempt to silence us is opposition or persecution.	513	Was God’s confidence in Daniel misplaced?	442

Among the obligations of husbands and wives are these cited by the apostle Paul: “Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord . . .	20	3 Jehovah fulfills his promises, not just out of love for his servants but especially for the sake of his own name.	540

Though Jehovah is almighty and dwells in heaven, he gives attention “to the one humble and broken in spirit who trembles at [His] word.”	898	(Ephesians 6:17; 2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) Deft use of God’s written Word, the Bible, helps us to teach the truth and safeguards us from succumbing to the Devil’s wiles.	454

Really, like any human, he was barely more than an insect​—in this case, one that Jehovah was ready to exterminate!	660	(Isaiah 48:17) Any such tangible benefits can rightly be viewed as blessings that prove the practicality of God’s laws.	802

Jesus was not tempted by some evil inside himself.	560	Though people speak about dedication in their pursuit of some goal​—money, fame, power, or position—​it is rare that a person comes across something so very desirable that he is willing to give up everything for it.	870

Mariage aga na changement ndali ti so mbi manda ti zia bê na ndo ti koli ti mbi.

Temple ti Jéhovah so ayeke aye so lo leke ti sara na lege ti sandaga ti Christ Jésus si azo aga nduru na lo ti voro lo.	7 Regarding the Lord’s Evening Meal, Paul said: “As often as you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives.” (1 Corinthians 11:26) Individual anointed Christians would partake of the Memorial emblems until their death.	376	That temple is Jehovah’s arrangement for approaching him in worship on the basis of the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ Jesus.	213

“Tongaso, Lo gue na yâ da ti Farizien so, na Lo duti na table ti te kobe.	James 2:15, 16 states: “If a brother or a sister is in a naked state and lacking the food sufficient for the day, yet a certain one of you says to them: ‘Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,’ but you do not give them the necessities for their body, of what benefit is it?”	817	“Accordingly he entered into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table.	426

Tongana a tene mbeni ye ayeke dä encore ape, donc lo yeke dä kozo na mbeni ndo. A yeke tongaso ape?

Nde na so, Jésus asala tene gi ti aye use ti soro.	Rather, for about six years, he humbly accompanied the older prophet and assisted him, later being known as the one “who used to pour out water on the hands of Elijah.” (2 Kings 3:11) How comforting for Elijah to have such a capable, helpful attendant!	816	In contrast, Jesus spoke of only two choices.	335
A yeke ndali ni la e yeke na bezoin ti ngere so a futa ti zi na azo.​—Diko aRomain 5:12; 6:23.	13 Our prayers to God reveal our motives, interests, and desires. Jehovah knows what we are inside. Says Proverbs 17:3: “The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, but Jehovah is the examiner of hearts.” God sees what is in our heart.	163	That is why we need a ransom.​—Read Romans 5:12; 6:23.	173

Mo yeke sala ngangu ti sala ye alingbi na aye so mo manda si mo tambela tongana ‘wandara’? (aEphésien 5:15-17, NW; Psaume 1:1-3).	What shows that the holy spirit is a force for cleanness among God’s people, and how can you show that you are cooperating with the spirit?	683	Do you try to apply what you read, so that you will walk as a ‘wise person’? (Ephesians 5:15-17; Psalm 1:1-3) If you do that, you are drawing close to Jehovah.	281

Do you see why that should be encouraging to us?	972	(Ex. 40:12, 13) Evidently, Jehovah forgave Aaron for his weakness.	877
2 Ngbene ye na ngoi so Satan asara ngangu-li, lo ga kota wato ti Jéhovah nga wato ti azo kue.	Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will be gathered on this special night to observe this Memorial in the manner Jesus commanded.	368	2 Since his rebellion, Satan has proved to be Jehovah’s greatest enemy, and he certainly has not been a friend of mankind.	544

Tongana Moïse ahunda ti ba gloire ti Lo, Jéhovah akiri tene: “Mo lingbi ba lê ti Mbi pepe, teti zo so aba lê ti Mbi alingbi ngbâ na fini pepe.”	14 How, then, can we acquire the ability to distinguish between right and wrong?	802	When Moses asked to see His glory, Jehovah responded: “You are not able to see my face, because no man may see me and yet live.”	978
Ka ti prophétie so asala tënë ti mbo ti ngonda so ayeke lango place oko na molenge ti taba, nga molenge ti ngasa na ze?	So Elijah modestly replied: “You have asked a difficult thing.	11	Or what of the prophecy of the wolf with the lamb and the kid with the leopard?	937

Just as we give constant attention to our physical hygiene, so we must regularly submit to the purifying influence of God’s word of truth.	870	As he turns to look out at the capital of the Roman Empire, no doubt the words that the Lord Jesus spoke to him at the Tower of Antonia in Jerusalem come to his mind.	178

(aRomain 1:7).	15 The success of most of Jehovah’s Witnesses in maintaining exemplary standards is seen in comments about them that have been published over the years.	166	(Romans 1:7, footnote) These holy ones had obviously not yet died, nor had they because of outstanding virtue been set apart above the rest of the believers.	297

Prophétie ti Esaïe afa so biani a yeke mû gloire na ni.	No, he gave glory to “God in the heavens who is a Revealer of secrets.”	869	Isaiah’s prophecy said that it would.	863
Na ngoi so Jéhovah atene na lo so ni ye si lo ga “prophète ti amara”, Jérémie adekongo, lo tene: “Aï, Seigneur L’Eternel! bâ, mbi hinga lege ti sara tënë pëpe, teti mbi de molenge.”	We do not have to be wealthy to help out.	296	When Jehovah informed him of his commission to be “prophet to the nations,” he cried out: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!	866
E mû lege ni so ahon na yâ ti ando so ayeke gi polele tongaso ti gue na katikati ti Soudan.	In harmony with Jehovah’s command, they entered the Promised Land and began to conquer it.	766	The road wound its way through the barren landscape toward the Sudan border.	679
Na ndo lo, Paul atene: “Lo so ahu pono ti [keke ti pasi, NW ], Lo bâ kamene ni tongana ye senge teti tâ ngia so A zia na gbele Lo, na Lo duti na koti ti trône ti Nzapa.” (aHébreu 12:2).	So we do well to consider Jesus’ faithful course and see what we must do to show that we too wish to uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty.​—Job 1:6-12; 2:2-6.	190	Of Jesus, Paul said: “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:2) Notice that Jesus ‘despised shame.’	829
Na Aggée 2:6, e diko tënë so: “L’Eternel Ti Sabaoth atene tongaso, A ngbâ lâ mingi pëpe, fade Mbi yengi ayayu na sese, kota ngu ti ingo na kuru sese.”	Instead, many taught that each individual must decide for himself what is right and what is wrong.	507	At Haggai 2:6, we read: “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Yet once​—it is a little while—​and I am rocking the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry ground.’”	609
Versê 16 atene na pekoni: “Ala kiri, me ala kiri pëpe na Lo Ti Nduzu Ahon Kue.”	A Time of Tests and Rewards	806	Hos 7 Verse 16 adds: “They proceeded to return, not to anything higher”​—that is, “not to an elevated form of worship.”	101
(Matthieu 24:3, 14; Marc 13:10).	“Regret” is mental sorrow, pain of mind, at something done or perhaps left undone, and it can mean “to weep again.”	406	(Matthew 24:3, 14; Mark 13:10) He also explained that this monumental task is to be carried out in spite of formidable obstacles and challenges, even persecution.	554
[Afoto na lembeti 20]	Isaiah’s prophecy said that it would.	856	[Pictures on page 20]	496
Guengo na abungbi afa so e ye ti ga nduru mingi na Jéhovah nga na Molenge ti lo.	10 Moreover, propaganda promoting immorality seems to be everywhere.	37	Our attendance shows Jehovah that we want to draw close to him and his Son.	330
Aye so afa so mbeni lâ a yeke zi ala.	Christian husbands do not share that hardhearted, casual view of providing for their own.	180	They had now had a taste of God’s Word​—and they wanted more!	35

When Jehovah informed him of his commission to be “prophet to the nations,” he cried out: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!	857	17. (a) How was sacred service perverted in the days of Moses? (b) How could sacred service be misdirected today?	630
Tapande wa afa so aTémoin ti Jéhovah abâ amba ti ala pëpe tongana awande?	With Nathan in 1955	427	What recent developments show that the concept of “foreigner” can be overcome?	528

Oko pëpe, lo mû gloire na ‘Nzapa so ayeke na yayu so afa tënë ti lingo na gigi.’	“The earth [“earth’s population,” footnote] was divided,” says the Bible, in the days of Peleg, who was born about 250 years before Abraham.	38	No, he gave glory to “God in the heavens who is a Revealer of secrets.”	856
Tongana ti so e yeke sara hange lakue si saleté aduti na tere ti e pëpe, legeoko nga a lingbi e yeda lakue ti tene tënë ti Nzapa so ayeke tâ tënë asara si e ga nzoni-kue.	Though people speak about dedication in their pursuit of some goal​—money, fame, power, or position—​it is rare that a person comes across something so very desirable that he is willing to give up everything for it.	740	Just as we give constant attention to our physical hygiene, so we must regularly submit to the purifying influence of God’s word of truth.	793
(Jean 11:1-45) Tondo so akono pepe beku so a lingbi ti kiri azo so mo ndoye ala mingi na fini na yâ fini sese ti Nzapa?

Consider a few of the wonderful things that Jehovah has been doing with his willing, although imperfect, people.	547	A young man who is not a dedicated member of the congregation may show interest in a young Christian woman (or vice versa), and there is pressure to compromise on the standards that Jehovah has set.	325
Aye ti nzoni wa azo ti ndara ayeke wara?	We heard all of that from our room upstairs.	237	What rewards do the prudent reap?	2
(Jean 3:36). A yeke na lege ti mandango ye na yâ Bible: mandango ye na ndo Nzapa, na ndo Molenge ti lo, na ndo ye so bê ti Lo aye nga na salango ye alingbi na ni, si mo lingbi ti soro fini.	After the people of Israel occupied comfortable houses and had an abundance of food and wine, “they began to eat and to be satisfied and to grow fat.”	945	(John 3:36) You can choose life by learning about God, his Son, and His will from the pages of the Bible and by applying what you learn.	54
Ala yeke na mosoro teti so ala yeke na mabe nga ala yeke be-ta-zo na Nzapa.	(Revelation 1:10; 7:9-14) Never before in human history have millions from all nations been united in worship of the only true God.	667	They were rich because of their faith and integrity to God.	149
Fa so mo yeke nduru ti zia ambeni ye yamba	(Psalm 118:1, 29) These may well have been the last words of praise that Jesus Christ sang with his faithful apostles on the night before his death in 33 C.E.—Matthew 26:30.	91	Display a Self-Sacrificing Spirit	448
Kota ye so ayeke sara si mbeni mariage aduti na ngia ayeke so wa?	(Ex. 40:12, 13) Evidently, Jehovah forgave Aaron for his weakness.	787	What is the key to a successful marriage?	159
Atâa so dutingo kumbamba ayeke mbeni sacrifice, a yeke duti mbeni pendere matabisi tongana mo sara kusala na ni nzoni.”	Jacques Johnson, a Catholic priest, wrote in a Canadian weekly about his efforts to dissuade a woman from studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.	60	Singleness, though it is a sacrifice, is an amazing gift if you take advantage of it.”	126
Kusala, ye ti bibe, hingango ye, na ndara, ayeke na ndo-ti-awakinda pepe.’	It is found in the latter part of verse 32, which reads: “Now, O our God, the God great, mighty and fear-inspiring, keeping the covenant and loving-kindness, do not let all the hardship that has found us, our kings, our princes and our priests and our prophets and our forefathers and all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria down to this day, seem little before you.”	661	There is no pursuit, no plan, no knowledge or intelligence, within the grave.”	689
Azo ayeke descend na yâ ti ataxi na devant ti da ni, a ninga ape yâ ti kota da ni asi na azo.	Appreciative Israelites gave their best to support true worship	292	Large taxicabs drop off their fashionable passengers in front of the hall, and soon the main auditorium is packed.	76
Atâa ye ni ayeke tongana nyen, Rébecca ayeke pensé na ndo ti gigi ti lo ti kekereke, peut-être na gingo kue ti hinga ye na ndo ti Éliezer, Isaac nga na asewa ti lo.	She searched for answers to her spiritual questions in Catholicism, the religion in which she was raised, and in Asian philosophy.	328	At any rate, Rebekah looked ever forward, no doubt trying to learn all she could from Eliezer about Isaac and his family.	624
Lo kiri lo tene: “Zo so asala lo mveni kete tongana kete molenge so, lo yeke kota ahon na yâ royaume ti yayu.”	What must one be cautious of when planning for the future?	932	He continued: “Whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one that is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.”	184
Na pekoni, Jésus atene mbeni kpengba tâ tënë so ayeke fa lege na aChrétien juska laso: “Azo kue so amû épée ayeke kui ande na lege ti épée.”—Mat. 26:51, 52.	Now, I’m sure you would agree that for something to be no more, it had to exist in the first place.	774	Then Jesus stated a fundamental truth, a principle that guides his followers to this day: “All those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.”​—Matt. 26:51, 52.	356
(Esaïe 31:4) Ye oko, atä lege so mbeni bamara so ade pendere na so ayeke na kuä ti go ayeke ga na ngangu tongana lo ye ti sala sioni na zo polele, e yeke dö lo na gere na lege ti fä na mango yanga ti Nzapa ahon ti mä yanga ti azo wala ti abungbi so ayeke sala ye tongana abamara.	When the Nahuatl translation team was formed, I was invited to be part of it.	204	(Isaiah 31:4) Regardless of how fierce the maned young lion may be when making a frontal attack, though, we figuratively trample on it by obeying God rather than lionlike men or organizations.	205
Atâ Chrétien ayeke sara ngangu ti duti azo so ayeke sara ye na lege ni, so ayeke sara kua ngangu nga ayeke sara kua ti ala na bê ti ala kue (aColossien 3:22, 23).	This experience illustrates that making wise decisions is a challenge.	666	True Christians strive to be honest, diligent, and conscientious workers. (Colossians 3:22, 23) Whether they are employed or they have their own business, they often do well, even excel in what they do.	591
Lo tene: “Mbi lingbi sara ye kue na yâ Lo so asara si mbi wara ngangu.”​—aPhilippien 4:13.	WHO WAS HE?	488	(2 Corinthians 12:9, 10) “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me,” he wrote.​—Philippians 4:13.	806

Laso, aDa ti Royaume ti aTémoin ti Jéhovah na yâ ti kodoro ayeke ando ti tâ vorongo Nzapa. 6:19, 22, 32.	How do the Scriptures highlight the uniqueness of Jesus?	416	Today, Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s Witnesses are centers of true worship in the community.	453
“Azo so awoko” aye ti sara tënë ti azo so vundu asara ala mingi nga na ala so bê ti ala anze.	One member of the family may say or do something that offends another.	161	“Depressed souls” are weak, in a sense, and so are discouraged ones.	381
Jésus atene so tâ tënë ayeke tongana ngu so amû na zo fini ti lakue lakue (Jean 4:13, 14).	Second, we supplicate Jehovah in prayer to open the heart of sincere ones.	563	Jesus once described the message of truth as being like water that imparts everlasting life.	299

Just a brief brush with pornography can have sad consequences.	901	According to WHO, there are now over a billion smokers in the world, and some four million deaths a year can be attributed to tobacco.	183
(Mat. 6:24). Tongana e duti ngbâa ti “Mosoro”, e yeke zia lege ti sarango na Jéhovah, na a yeke tâ ye so Satan aye e sara la!	(Ezekiel 7:19) On the other hand, “a great crowd,” who prudently ‘stored up their treasures in heaven’ by putting spiritual interests first in their life, will benefit from their sure investment and gain eternal life in a paradise earth.​—Revelation 7:9, 14; 21:3, 4; Matthew 6:19, 20.	483	(Matt. 6:24) If we slave exclusively for Riches, we have stopped serving Jehovah, and that is precisely what Satan wants us to do!	696
Atâa so Jéhovah ayeke na ngangu mingi nga lo yeke na yayu, lo yeke bi bê ti lo na ‘zo so ayeke na tâ be-ti-molenge, so yingo ti lo ayeke na vundu, so tere ti lo adö tongana lo mä tënë ti lo’.	If I was at home when they visited, they also spoke with me.	734	Though Jehovah is almighty and dwells in heaven, he gives attention “to the one humble and broken in spirit who trembles at [His] word.”	257
28 Zia si bibe so ala yeke na ni ti sara ye na bê ti ala wani asepela Jéhovah!	However, during those moments, I thought of Peter’s words to Jesus: “Lord, whom shall we go away to?	338	28 May Your Volunteer Spirit Bring Praise to Jehovah!	836

18 Na yengo dä ti ga na sese, Jésus ‘azia gloire ti Lo, Lo kamata tere ti ngbâa, Lo ga tongana zo’. (aPhilippien 2:7).	(Read 1 Corinthians 13:4-8.)	245	18 Having accepted the assignment to come to the earth, Jesus “emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men.”	553
