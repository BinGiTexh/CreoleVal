Hvis læreren skal planlegge en ferie eller noe annet som krever at man ser på priser og regner ut hva det vil koste, da er det elevenes kunnskaper han benytter seg av. Noen ganger ønsker kona seg nytt fruktfat, eller kanskje er det mannen som ønsker seg brevkniv, mange har sønner som trenger et godnatt-eventyr på senga eller døtre med dukker som trenger klær av siste mote; alt dette får læreren elevene til å lage for ham.	He is an evildoer, are you aware of that?	348	If the teacher is to plan out a vacation or something similar requiring one to compare prices and figure out what it would cost, it is the pupils' skills he would exploit.

Uansett hvilket musikkinstrument du ønsker å lære å spille, er det viktigste å unngå å gjøre feil fra begynnelsen av, fordi feilene du gjør lettere fester seg i hodet ditt enn alt det du gjør rett.

Tre timer senere, slentret kongen rundt om i slottet etter noe å ta opp tiden med. "Faen som jeg kjeder meg," klaget han fortvilet. "Barna er på skolen, Gwo er på arbeid, Impa er på sykehuset, Ganon—" Plutselig hørte kongen et uforståelig skrik og snudde seg for å se, hvorpå Fari for forbi ham. "Dæven, Fari. Hva var det for noe?!" "Ryk og reis, Deres Majestet!" Ropte Fari av full hals. "Du verden... Du har mensen som vanlig, ser jeg," fortsatte kongen å mumle nedslått. "Helvete som jeg kjeder meg. Ingenting verdt å se på på TV. Ingenting kjekt på nett. Ingenting godt å spise." Idet han var i ferd med å forlate spisesalen, ble oppmerksomheten tatt opp av en ensom krukke kanel på bordet. En skje fylt med kanel var beleilig satt ned ved siden av den. Hadde kongen da vært mer tilregnelig, hadde han nok vært noenlunde mistenksom, men da han var så utmattet av kjedsomhet at enhver mulighet å slukke den om bare i et minutt føltes ut som en velsignelse. "Jeg lurer meg på hva malt kanel smaker," sa han likeglad idet han stappet skjea i munnen.	Every man can't be an artist.	661	Three hours later, the King was loitering around the castle, looking for something to busy himself with. "Fuck, I'm so bored," he grumbled in exasperation. "The kids are at school. Gwo's at work. Impa's at the hospital. Ganon—" Suddenly the King heard an incomprehensible cry and turned around to see Fari rush past him. "Damn, Fari, what was that?!" "Piss off, Your Majesty!" Fari yelled at the top of his lungs. "My... PMSing as usual, I see," the King continued to mutter dejectedly. "Shit, I'm so fucking bored. Nothing good on TV. Nothing good online. Nothing good to eat." As he was about to leave the dining hall, his eyes were drawn to a cinnamon jar standing lonely on the table. A spoon of cinnamon was placed conveniently next to it. In a saner state the King may have been reasonably suspicious about it, but now he was so exhausted from boredom that any opportunity to relieve it for a minute felt like a blessing. "I wonder what ground cinnamon tastes like," said he nonchalantly and put the spoon in his mouth.	876
