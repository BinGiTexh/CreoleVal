	<h1><h1>Program on Education : For Equality in Education, For Equality in Society</h1><p class="subtitle">20.11.2006</p></h1>
	<p class="newsarticle">The subject of childrenâs education is close to everyoneâs hearts.  Itâs close to Lalitâs heart, too. And while different political  currents have very different ways of seeing education, any given education system  is clearly both a reflection of society, and also something that, to some extent,  in turn also moulds society. The education system also invariably involves some  kind of fairly direct response to the demands the economy puts on it, in terms  of the kind of skilled workers required. That is how an economy based on agriculture,  as Mauritius was in the 1960âs and 1970âs, needed a majority of  children to have actually failed the Certificate of Primary Education (CPE),  so that they would docilely accept the bad work conditions of the cane fields  as a punishment for their failure. The economy demanded them and the education  system provided them. In the same way, it provided unskilled workers for textile  factories in the Export Processing Zone in the 1970âs. At that very time,  the Government departments and professions also needed their fairly narrow,  hierarchical ranks filled as the British withdrew their civil servants in the  run-up to Independence and as the Parti Mauricien Social Democrate (PMSD) anti-Independence  campaign made the existing intelligencia flee the country because of supposed  threat of âHindu perilâ. So the same CPE examination that condemned  masses of young people to unskilled work also prepared a small new elite by  creaming off the âbestâ pupils for further schooling, and for further  creaming-off a few years later in the School Certificate and then the Higher  School Certificate examinations.<br /><br />The very dynamic debates on education going on today are certainly a direct  result of the fact that the collapse of sugar and textiles is forcing the capitalist  classes to invest in other sectors, including many where Information Technology  is involved and that require a generally high level of education from the masses  of workers. The education system has thus fallen behind the economy, and this  is what is causing the particular heat of the debates.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Hegemony</strong><br /><br />Today in Mauritius we are under the hegemony of the capitalist system. This  means something very precise. It means that dominant ideas have a much greater  effect on us than we could ever believe something as vague as âideasâ  might have. Everything we think, even everything we do, is influenced by these  ideas that taken as a whole are the âideologyâ 2 engendered and  nurtured by the dominant class. This capitalist ideology is strong for the simple  reason that capitalism is in power, and âitsâ ideas have the double  strength of being both ideas and reality. This reality produces the ideology,  and the ideology, in turn, re-secures the reality by maintaining class domination  and exploitation. And this is how capitalism is still perpetuating itself, not  like how other previous systems perpetuated themselves. This means that the  mode of production is being maintained thanks to the ideology that âjustifiesâ  it. It is only in exceptional circumstances that the system needs to resort  to overt repression and institutionalized violence to maintain its rule, although  the arsenals are always ready and waiting. And ideology functions in such a  way that even when there is repression and violence of an every-day nature,  we actually fail to see it for what it is. This âinvisible repressionâ  takes all kinds of shapes. Imagine a head of household is sacked by his boss,  left without any revenue whatsoever. This is a fact of life. The factory is  the bossâs, the job is his, and he has just taken it back from the man.  We see no violence in this act of deliberately starving the workerâs children.<br /><br />The education system is linked to the dominant ideology in many different ways.  Letâs take one example.<br /><br />Todayâs bourgeois ideology leads everyone to believe that, in order to  change the capitalist system, or even just some of its deleterious effects like  inequality, poverty, domination, or anything else, all you need to do is to  change people âthrough educationâ. Even if you go around asking  people one-by-one whatâs the one thing they would want to change so that  society can be better, a vast majority (including most of the âniceâ  people we all know) would reply, âChange the education system!â  And they would be misleading us badly, of course. There is little chance of  any change in the education system being the direct cause of change in the economy.  Education is a product of the economic system, and, at the end of the day, it  bows to the economyâs needs. What is true is that political change that  manages to bring a change in the economic system could change inequality, domination,  exploitation, and in turn, bring fantastic changes to the education system.</b></p><b><br /><p><br /><br /><br /><strong>The hidden functions of education</strong><br /><br />So, itâs the economy that, in the final analysis defines the education  system. And then the education system, in turn, has a number of functions within  the dominant economic and political structure. It re-enforces all sorts of ground-rules  for the economic system. These functions of the education system are often well  nigh invisible. Parents in the working classes, for example, get a handy place  to park their kids for the day, while one or both go out to work in the fields,  factories and offices for the owners of enterprises. Children are kept closed  up so they donât go around getting up to mischief, thus freeing their  parents to work for an entrepreneur. And while the children are closed up like  this, they are learning other things. They are learning first and foremost to  stay put. They are acquiring the habit of sitting in one place for six hours  a day, and what with the private lessons racket, eight or nine hours a day.  They are being trained for the eight or nine hours they will need to do sitting  at a machine or a desk at work later in their lives. They will by then think  itâs normal. They are also learning how to listen. They are being taught  obedience to the teacher, which can neatly be transferred to obedience to the  boss later. Children are learning that above their teacher, there is someone  else higher, a Deputy Head Teacher, and above this person, there is one higher  still, a Head Teacher, and above this person, there is another one still higher,  an Inspector, and above him or her, a Chief Inspector, and so on. The child  is learning to accept as natural or god-given the hierarchies they will have  to cower to and fit into in later life. Children learn regimentation, too. So  that when they grow up, they can fit into the army of workers in factories,  without too much complaint.<br /><br />At the same time, and this is something people do notice, the education system  transmits ideas that actually set out to justify the dominant economic system.  Sometimes these ideas are embedded in stories, assumptions to stories, and sometimes  they are opinions disguised as facts.<br /><br />The sad reality behind the âequal opportunitiesâ slogan<br /><br />One of the most firmly believed in elements in present-day capitalist ideology  is: âEveryone has a chance to climb the social ladder.â This is  the equal opportunities ideology. People often imply that this can be done âthrough  educationâ.<br /><br />Letâs take a closer look at this innocent-looking phrase, âEveryone  has a chance to climb the social ladder.â The first thing we notice is  that it masks another layer of meaning. Just under this sentence, another sentence  is hiding, embedded, and it reads: âIt is natural that certain people  are higher, and others lowerâ. Or, if not natural, it is justifiable,  or if not, at least it is inevitable. Whichever way, the assumption is there.  And we never get a chance to get to the really important question, morally and  politically speaking, which is âShould there be some people at the bottom  and others on the top?â<br /><br />The most unjust and absurd inequality is, thus, assumed. Debate thus remains  stunted and intentionally crippled. Debate is only at the level of whether everyone  does or does not have an equal opportunity (to become unequal). The corollary  gets us even more stuck. Peopleâs demand then gets limited to the very  narrow, and probably erroneous one of: âAll children should be given equal  opportunitiesâ (assumed: to become unequal). This demand with all its  appearance of something kind and reasonable is actually masking the diabolical  logic of inequality. It not only masks individual inequality, which is bad enough,  but also class inequality. This demand keeps class society in place, by promising  either actual mobility, or at the very least, a mirage of mobility. To understand  this, just take a moment to imagine how if every child did well at school, all  would rise, and there would not be a class society forever and ever after.<br /><br />Perhaps the enormity of the argumentation is best exposed by transferring it  backwards 200 years in time. Someone says: âHere, all slaves get the same  portions of rations!â The effect of this statement is to run the risk,  if its assumptions are not questioned, of leading to the demand: âAll  slaves must get the same portion of rations!â While the statements hide  the very fact of slavery, implying that it is a good thing, natural or at best,  inevitable. This is clearly a morally untenable position.<br /><br />In the same way, the capitalist ideology that âeach child has equal opportunitiesâ  clearly represents a shift from the clear position that society should be more  equal, to the abject position of acceptation of inequality. This shift is hidden  by offering the real (or imagined, it often makes little difference) opportunity  for each person to be given his or her appropriate rung on the ladder of inequality.  Those who do well at school will get (or will imagine getting) a good job, a  high pay, those who do less well a bad job and low pay. Then a lot of argument  goes into whether the choosing of individuals for the jobs was âfairâ  or not. Of course, the logic also goes that if you do really badly itâs  presumably the moral justification for being starved to death in unemployment  without the right to any income at all.<br /><br />A similar shift, or drift, has been clear in the womenâs movement recently.  The struggle for emancipation and liberation of all women, and the opposition  to patriarchy and its hierarchies, has, in some quarters, been replaced by a  quest for âgender equityâ. The aim is for women to rise within the  untouched, existing hierarchies, where instead of precipitating emancipation  or liberation, they run the risk of further entrenching the very patriarchal  pyramids that keep women under oppression.<br /><br /><br /><strong>The State</strong><br /><br />A whole arsenal of institutions spends day and night keeping inequality unchallenged.  They do this unconsciously most of the time. There is the family (as an institution),  the education system, Government, different religious hierarchies, the press,  and advertisements. The totality of these institutions, in the precise meaning  of the word, makes up what we call âthe Stateâ.<br /><br />We mention this because it is important to realize that however much the education  system is changed (even if we could make it well nigh perfect, which we cannot  because of the hegemony of bourgeois ideology), it is not changes in the education  system that are primarily whatâs necessary in order to change society,  or to change the State.<br /><br />And yet, we in Lalit, even knowing this, are at the forefront of the struggle  for a better education system.<br /><br />Education has other important kinds of potential. For a start, it imparts to  children the magic capacity to be able to read and write. (Or it should do so,  and it certainly can do so). This way children are introduced to ideas. Children  learn de-contextualized, abstract ideas, that can so easily to seen when they  are âout thereâ in writing, and not inextricably linked to the speaker  and listener, in the way naturally spoken language is. And this kind of abstract  thinking is essential to our human capacity to develop a vision of a new kind  of society. It is essential for us to be able to understand, and contribute  to the building of a political program and political strategy, in a conscious  way. Reading and writing helps enormously in this process.<br /><br />Itâs important to keep in mind, though, that it is only in the course  of major revolutionary changes that the idea of equality (whether in the economy  or in education) turns into a major winnable demand. In fact, the biggest literacy  and mass education campaign in any one country in all history was the campaign  in the immediate wake of the 1917 Russian Revolution 3, when the masses were  still in a state of mobilization. This is actually one of the little-known successes  of that revolution. And the other big literacy campaigns have also been during  mass uprisings, as in China 4, Nicaragua, Guinea-Bissau 5 Mozambique 6 and even  nearer us, in Seychelles.<br /><br />In Mauritius we all know that it was the mass student rebellion of May 1975  6 that put free education on the agenda at the same time as seeking a more egalitarian  society in general.<br /><br />Today in Lalit, we act on the assumption that it is important for people to  be prepared for this kind of program that represents a big leap forward. We  know that history rarely presents the opportunity for massive changes in the  education system, but we know that these opportunities often come out of crises.  We have to prepare to the highest degree possible before the events are upon  us.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Capitalist economy demands a more literate workforce</strong><br /><br />Meanwhile, the education system is not producing enough workers who can read  and write sufficiently well to cope with industryâs demand. The social  ladder no longer holds out much hope that we might rise a few rungs. It is offering  more rungs at the bottom, and the middle classes, as everyone can clearly see,  have been panicking in case their kids slide down.<br /><br />This is because the present crisis is a systemic one. It is affecting the whole  of society, including the middle classes. While those at the bottom of the social  ladder stagnate there, or get even poorer, falling into unemployment or the  most unstable of jobs, dependent on social security hand-outs, turning to live  from theft and robbery, not to mention from peddling drugs, and in general being  pushed to the very margins of society.<br /><br />And meanwhile, there are loads of people, and often those with the best of intentions,  who believe firmly that many of the social problems of today (crime, robbery,  hold-ups, violence, rape and every other imaginable problem) are caused by people  having the wrong sort of âmentalityâ. So they say everyone should  run around âchanging other peoplesâ mentalityâ. And this,  they believe, is often done âthrough educationâ. They are convinced  that if only they could change peoplesâ mentality, make them become âgoodâ  people, then all at once all the ills of society would evaporate into thin air.  Everyone, they imply, would even become equal.<br /><br />Once we can see exactly what they are saying, we can perhaps understand the  campaign run mainly with money from business that is also bent on âeducatingâ  the poor and âinculcatingâ good values into them willy-nilly. They  intend thus to âchange the mentalityâ of the poor in a most paternalistic  manner. This is fortunately is a doomed venture. Because in reality, the causes  are elsewhere and not in peoplesâ âmentalityâ. The proportion  of people who are active in the criminal world in order to survive is, for example,  directly linked to the percentage in unemployment, very dodgy work, and living  without a proper home. In other words, social problems are linked very closely,  even if not in a strictly linear fashion, to the economy. And so even if everyone  in one fell swoop got very well educated, this would not have any direct bearing  on the central economic problems that Mauritius is facing today.<br /><br />But in Lalit we believe that, even before any profound revolutionary movement  rises again, there are, however, some changes in the education system that could  help children, when they grow up, participate better in the quest for a better  society. For example, learning at school in the mother tongue is an obvious  advantage, in its liberation of people from the yoke of colonization. As we  have mentioned, the very fact of being literate gives children (and adults)  the chance to free their minds from the chains of the here and now. And if the  content of school subjects was broadened, this too could help children become  more mature adults, stable enough to contemplate committing themselves to long-term  plans for change. And of course, if children acquire nimble thinking, more logical  approaches, and develop creativity, they will grow up into the kind of adults  who can question the inequalities and injustices of the system thatâs  here today, and thus put into question the very class system that upholds the  economy, the patriarchy that keeps women oppressed and the communalism and racism  that pervades society.<br /><br />What we are proposing as changes in the education system in this Program is  not the key to changing society. It will not automatically bring equality in  society. Far from it. Such fundamental changes come from changing the economy,  which is done through political action. However, changing the education system  has its relative importance: a better education system can create some of the  dynamics in society that make young people put into question the entire edifice  7.<br /><br /><br /><strong>The importance of the education system</strong><br /><br />Through good education, children can obviously develop their intelligence and  their creativity. Whether children are from a rich or a poor family from an  orderly household or a rather chaotic one, the education system can contribute  to developing their capacity to understand the world around them, and their  capacity to participate in creating a better world to live in.<br /><br />But the education system in Mauritius is not doing any of this. So, we have  to change it. This Lalit program, taken as a whole and together with the demands  listed towards the end, aims at precisely that: proposals as to how to analyze  the education system, how to imagine something better, and how we can put forward  demands that are simple and effective for setting in action dynamics that move  us from where we are today towards a better education for all children.<br /><br />There are always lots of people, at any one time, who want to change the education  system. Today there are plenty. They all share some of the following ideas:  the education system could be different from what it is, it could be better,  it could involve rather less competition amongst the children, it could be more  egalitarian, it could develop the potential of all children rather better than  it does. What this means is that many people who are not prepared to put into  question the economic or political system, are nevertheless able to hold progressive  ideas on the education of children. This is certainly true over the past 6 to  7 years. It is as though the economic crisis has brought some thinking, and  this has led to the middle classes being terrified of finding themselves hurled  into the working class. And there is also a feeling that âinequalityâ  when applied to little children is hideous, even if when applied to adults it  is acceptable. Similarly, cut throat âcompetitionâ between 11-year-olds  at school is often considered appalling by the very same people who believe  that competition is natural to the rest of capitalism.<br /><br />The last Education Minister, Steeve Obeegadoo, of the MSM-MMM government did  manage to introduce certain changes towards regionalization of intake designed  to decrease competition. Today the MMM has taken the initiative of a legal challenge  against Labour Party Education Minister, Dharam Gokhool of the Social Alliance  Government, as part of their opposition to creating an elite amongst 11-year-olds.<br /><br />Most editorialists in a generally pro-capitalist press are against the Gokhool  A+ examination on the grounds that it brings elitism.<br /><br />The Catholic Church, especially since the 1999 riots after the death in police  custody of Kaya, has realized that the youth of the country are rebellious,  and have changed their approach in education from very elitist to âcaring  for mixed abilitiesâ and a more egalitarian approach.<br /><br />So, the challenge against Gokhoolâs plan is quite unusually generalized,  and what we have to avoid is the communalization or ethnicization of the opposition.<br /><br />So, it is true to say that from all quarters there are social forces challenging  the present education system.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Contestation</strong><br /><br />Thereâs always been contestation of the colonial education system that  Mauritius inherited. In May 1975 students rose up and demonstrated for free  education, equality in the level of education, for the use of the mother tongue,  for respect of pupilâs home environment, for the teaching of Mauritian  history in schools, for more liberty, and for a kind of learning that didnât  rely on repression and punishment, that did not foster communalism, racism,  sexism either. Quite a few Lalit activists were in the movement, either as students  or as teachers. Our program is until today influenced by the progress in thinking  made during that big movement.<br /><br />Today, 31 years after the May 1975 student uprising, there is still, or there  is once again, unrest on the issue of education. In fact, it never really stopped.  It just became less marked from time to time. After the victories of May 1975,  when free secondary education for all was introduced as from 1977, there were  also defeats. The system continued in its patent inequality. It was still a  carbon copy of the colonial education system. A majority of children were still  being branded for unskilled jobs. So, contestation continued, and this in spite  of a number of reforms, timid though they were, introduced by Ministers like  Pillay and Obeegadoo.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Changes in the Economy Now</strong><br /><br />The reason for the present contestation is undoubtedly, as we mentioned earlier,  the changes in the economy. And these changes have, in turn, been detonated  by the changes in the world economic system. The protectionism that Mauritian  bosses benefited from since Independence has been torn apart. Sugar and textiles,  the two big employers of workers, are both, as a result, on the verge of collapse.  At the same time, the Government and para-statal sectors are decreasing staff  and workers. So, the economy is in a grave crisis. The form it is taking for  most of us is a crisis of unemployment. And it is following the satanic logic  of unbridled capitalism, of the neo-liberalism that rules the day, where, the  World Trade Organization rules are applied, where market forces reign in all  their cruelty, especially when it comes to weaker countries.<br /><br />The rule of supply and demand, as it breaks the sugar and textile industries,  thus affects the education system, because the economy no longer requires it  to âstrain offâ unskilled workers for these two huge sectors, nor  to âcatchâ a tiny administrative elite for the civil service and  professions. So the education system is out of step with the economy. It is  out of date. It is no longer viable in its present form.<br /><br />Almost every enterprise wants workers who can read and write well, who are computer  literate and who are at ease on electronic machinery. So it is no longer just  Lalit and a few progressive professionals who are criticizing the system, but  the very owners of capital are concerned. At the same time, parents of working  class children are realizing that their children need to become highly literate  to get any job at all in the future, so they mobilize. The present system is  not working, even in that sense. And the upper petit-bourgeois parents are stricken  lest their children not be able to compete on the new international market for  jobs in the upper echelons of private and public sectors.<br /><br />All these factors are leading to the setting up of new kinds of private educational  institutions that grow up like mushrooms all around us. They also lead to pressure  for schools and universities to produce broad-based educational success for,  if not all, at least very many.<br /><br /><br /><strong>âWorld Class Quality Educationâ?</strong><br /><br />So, the economy is demanding a higher level of education today or, as Minister  Gokhool is always putting it âa world class quality educationâ.<br /><br />But will Minister Gokhoolâs Plan to provide high-level education actually  work?<br /><br />The simple answer is never on your life.<br /><br />The category of A+ that Gokhool has introduced as a panacea, will, instead,  be like a virus in an already shaky education system.<br /><br />At primary level, there is the existing popular classification into âgoodâ  schools, ordinary schools and ZEP schools (for the poor areas). The âgoodâ  ones are still good for nothing except rote learning. The ordinary ones are  the same, only with lesser results in terms of success at rote learning, and  the ZEP schools have caused a social fracture between poor areas and other areas.  In addition, there are private paying primary schools now, also shooting up  like mushrooms all over. And then private companies are busy sponsoring government  ZEP schools. Thereâs also the unofficial business of private lessons,  and a moneymaking trade in schoolbooks, too. A+ will have a worsening effect  on all this. The ârushâ to the âgoodâ schools will get  worse. Parents, teachers and pupils will get even more drawn into an even tougher  rat race than the one Obeegadoo was trying to get them out of. And there is  no plan as to what to do to improve the ordinary and ZEP schools.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the A+ has effectively banished the national debate on the use of  the mother tongue as medium, as well as putting the debate on the curriculum  into the background. Everyone will be drawn back into the savage competition.  And at best, into debates about it.<br /><br />At the pre-primary level, there are already the hideous effects of the A+. Pre-primary  teachers in some schools have offered to do the Std I and II syllabus during  pre-primary school.<br /><br />At the secondary level, the elitist âNational Collegesâ that will  cater for some 1,260 pupils who get A+ at the CPE will, in no way, produce âworld  class quality educationâ. Those whose rote learning is best will arrive  there. And they will be in emotional distress from all the competition, as well  as unbalanced by believing at that young age in their intellectual superiority.  Nothing in this will help them think independently, rationally or creatively.<br /><br />For the Regional Colleges, Gokhool has no plan whatsoever, while for the Prevocational  classes, he seems to be, if anything, confirming them as a âcasteâ,  increasingly separate from mainstream secondary education. Whereas in the past,  it was possible for a pupil to do well and go back into the academic stream,  it will no longer be possible.<br /><br />In addition, there are the private paying Ecole du Centre and Le Bocage, for  example, which are colleges purpose-built for the economic elite of the country.<br /><br />So, secondary education is divided and divisive.<br /><br />The tertiary education sector is being offered up for âinvestmentâ  by Government under the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) under  the WTO. What happens is all sorts of business Universities (both teaching âbusinessâ  and little else, and also making money) come and set up shop. Then they complain  to the WTO that the University of Mauritius has unfair subsidies. Then the Government  pretends it only just realized that it is illegal under the WTO to subsidize  just the University of Mauritius, announces it cannot possibly subsidize all  these new âUniversitiesâ, so therefore it no longer subsidizes the  University of Mauritius.<br /><br />And the CMT textile company is now financing a course at the University of Mauritius,  a course cut to measure for its needs on the shop floor.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Bankruptcy of the education system</strong><br /><br />There have been all sorts of Reports 10, after all sorts of Commissions that  have, one after the other, pointed to the necessity for reform of the education  system. In Lalit, we would go further than most of these reports do, and say  that the education system is actually doing harm to children. It is doing harm,  not just to those who fail the CPE examination but also to the rest who pass,  and even to those whose results are supposed to be brilliant. Let us look at  the harm being done to children.<br /><br />Recently a group of psychologists expressed concern about the dangers to the  cognitive and emotional development of all children of introducing the A+ examination.  They wrote a joint letter to the Minister of Education 11. There are also University  lecturers who have pointed to the shortcomings in the âcognitive developmentâ  of university level students, causing them to suffer difficulties in coming  to grips with their work. In a Le Mauricien 12 article, an ex-student from the  elite Royal College gave witness to how any success he felt he had had in life  was in spite of and not due to the education system. In a Public Forum organized  by Ledikasyon pu Travayer, Lalit member, Dr. Ram Seegobin in 2002, described  from his own experience how difficult it was to juggle ideas the same way his  co-students at Balliol College at Oxford University, and that it took him some  six years to feel he had caught up.<br /><br />The Mauritius Examinations Syndicate (MES) recently published a Report on the  2005 CPE examinations that shows the bankruptcy of the education system. Levels  have fallen, it says. Most children have not developed critical thinking, and  could not reply logically to questions. None of the children got the maximum  score for essay writing in English, while 33.5% got zero. They also noted poor  performance in Mathematics and Science, which they put down in part to âpoor  language skillsâ. Many children, the report says, learn by rote and approach  their work in a mechanical way.<br /><br />Results of a recent British Council study in 2006, in various secondary schools  including the so-called âstar collegesâ, show that the level of  English is low. Many international companies at the Cybercity have complained  of the same problem. They note that there are very poor levels of English and  especially French amongst Mauritians they have been recruiting 14. Most young  Mauritians, they note, even those with a University degree, canât speak  French at all well, and their written English is weak. The levels of French  and English that they got in school is not enough to be useful even at the relatively  low level of what is required to work at a call centre.<br /><br />What this means is that the education system is not only against the interests  of the pupils, but is not even up to the minimum requirements of what the capitalist  system needs on the shop floor. Prof. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas 15 put it rather  well when at the Port Louis Theatre, speaking at an LPT public lecture in 2002,  she said: âCreativity comes before all inventions. This is true even as  regards the invention of objects and commodities. Investment follows creativity,  and high-level multi-lingualism increases creativity. Teaching language in an  additive way (when new languages are added to the progress already made by the  child in its mother-tongue) brings multi-lingualism to a high level. It is thus  true that any form of education that does not develop high-level multi-lingualism  is limiting creativity. This means education that is not done through the mother  tongue, is ruining the countryâs future. This should be of concern to  everyone.â<br /><br /><br /><strong>Studies in favour of using the mother tongue</strong><br /><br />Worldwide, endless studies have shown that the mother tongue is the finest tool  for use in schools. This means the medium must be the childâs natural  language. In a recent speech, Dr. Arnaud Carpooran 16, University of Mauritius  linguist, gave an excellent outline of the importance of developing oneâs  general language proficiency in oneâs own tongue first and foremost.<br /><br />Recently the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) was  commissioned by the African Union to do a huge study on the language issue in  education in Africa 17. The results, though not public yet have been circulated  to some of our members, and they show clearly that the mother tongue must be  used as medium for at the very least the first six years of school. The longer  the mother tongue remains the medium, the better the results. It is also clear  that the ability to master English and French is better, the longer the mother  tongue is used. We will come back to this.<br /><br />The longitudinal studies in the USA by David Ramirez, between 1983 and 1991  in California, Texas, Florida, New York and New Jersey, had already shown that  the longer children learn through their mother tongue (mainly Spanish in the  51 schools they followed for 7 years), the better they do at science, maths  and also at 2nd and 3rd languages. Similar studies in Mali, Mozambique 19 ,  Haiti 20 , Zambia, Malawi, Guatemala, Nigeria 21 and Papua New Guinea have all  given similar results. The studies by Jim Cummins 22 provide the theoretical  framework for understanding all these studies. He found that children have two  rather distinct language capacities, one he names Basic Interpersonal Communication  Skills (BICS) which you can acquire in a language that is not your own, and  the other, Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) which is badly stunted  if you are taught through a language that is not your own. His study, together  with those of Tove Skutnabb-Kangas 23 indicates that it takes some 7 years post-secondary  education in order to attempt to catch up what has been lost.<br /><br />The ADEA document has now come up with similar results after studying 25 African  countries. The authors maintain that it is essential that at least 6 years be  in the mother tongue if academic success in foreign languages is to be obtained.  Even in optimal conditions (which we donât really have in Mauritius),  they estimate that it takes 6 to 8 years of the study of, say, English or French,  for a child to be equipped to learn any other subject through the medium of  these languages. They are in favour of the use of the mother tongue in primary,  secondary and tertiary education. Optimal results are obtained, they say, from  the exclusive use of the mother tongue as medium for the first years and for  as long as possible. As late as possible a foreign language can be introduced  as medium, but even then, preferably only for a few subjects. Mother tongue  medium, they believe, is beneficial throughout an educational system.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Genocide </strong><br /><br />All pedagogues now agree that in Mauritius the schools are not only harming  children emotionally by suppressing the mother-tongue, but are also doing serious  âmental harmâ to the children, that is to say, interfering with  the childrenâs capacity to reason and understand. Article 2 of the United  Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  24 states that if a State inflicts âserious mental harmâ on a people  (defined linguistically) that this, just as physical extermination of a people  on the basis of language, amounts to genocide. In Mauritius it is Kreolophone  and Bhojpuriphone peoples that are being made to suffer âserious mental  harmâ as a result of their mother tongue.<br /><br />There is a second way in which the UN Convention defines linguistic genocide.  If a State, through its education system for example, attempts to âemptyâ  a whole linguistic category by forcing them to abandon their mother tongue in  practice, and ends up placing them into a different linguistic group. Here the  Government is emptying the peoples defined as being Kreolophone or Bhojpuriphone,  and converting them, by means of the education system, into Francophone and  Anglophone people. LPT had already written a letter to the previous Education  Minister, Steeve Obeegadoo 25 on this issue, accusing the government of genocide,  and now with the PT-PMXD government continuing in the same vein, LPT has written  to the new Minister.<br /><br />In addition, the Mauritian State is a signatory to the International Convention  on the Rights of the Child. Article 29 (a) of the Convention states that education  must aim to âdevelop the childâs personality, talents and mental  and physical capacities to his or her full potentialâ 26. The Mauritian  educational system certainly falls gravely short of this.<br /><br />However, in the Concluding Observations (commonly called COBS) of the UN Human  Rights Committee under the Civil and Political Rights Convention, the Mauritian  State was congratulated (rather too generously, it could be said) for taking  measures to ensure a certain measure of written Kreol in schools 27. But so  little has been done, and even less is being done.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Reform</strong><br /><br />It is true that some Education Ministers (especially Pillay and Obeegadoo) tried  to introduce certain reforms. The Governments that they were in certainly lacked  any political will, and their attempts to change education in a fundamental  way, failed. Steeve Obeegadoo tried to decrease competition by assuring all  children a place in a secondary school until the age of 16, but the plan was  so timid, on the one hand, and did not repose on a mobilization around a program,  on the other, that it probably permitted the reaction that we see in the âGokhool  Planâ.<br /><br />Today the education system is now coming under increasing criticism. Its weaknesses  are being increasingly exposed for all to see. Its examination system, still  run in the colonial way through Cambridge, has been criticized 28. There are  criticisms from all sides. Even the Catholic Church, that had had a whole history  of elitist and âspecificâ education is today criticizing the excessive  competition in education, taking up the education of those who have failed the  CPE, and more recently beginning to defy the Governmentâs language policy.  They have in fact introduced Kreol in classes of many of their Prevok schools.  Recently Bishop Maurice Piat said: âWhen a child hears his mother tongue  in school, he gets the wonderful feeling of welcome and of recognition of who  he is.â29 According to a Bureau dâEducation Catholique (BEC) study,  there are indications that children studying in the mother tongue are making  better progress than those who do not. 30 .<br /><br />Some Unions in the teaching sector have also taken a position in favour of better  education. It is true that teachers have an important role to play in the process  of changing the education system. It is of concern, however, that at present  nearly all the teachersâ unions have limited their thinking and actions  to very narrowly defined issues of work conditions and respect for acquired  rights, which, important as they are, should not mean any neglect for their  role in proposing changes in the education system as a whole. At the same time  as struggling for better work conditions, it is necessary for them to discuss  the content of education being offered, the medium used, the punitive methods  still resorted to. When unions come forward with ideas for improving education,  then we can expect to see parents supporting them in their struggle for better  work conditions. The alliance becomes a natural one. In France, the education  unions have a long history of fine contribution towards the thinking on the  education system 31.<br /><br />There are also editorialists 32 , academics and pedagogues 33 who agree on the  necessity of developing a new vision of education for the Republic of Mauritius,  one that responds to the needs of the modern age as well as being in the interests  of the pupils.<br /><br />And this is what Lalit has always stood for, too.<br /><br />And we regret hearing some parents in these times saying âI want a good  school for my child!â when it would be so much healthier to hear the same  parent say (as all parents in some epochs do say): âI want to help raise  the standard of the school in our neighbourhood.â In some times of history,  especially those where there are more mass movements, parents express hope for  better schools for everyone in the country, and in really big movements, for  everyone in the whole world.<br /><br /><br /><strong>The Progress of the Mother Tongue</strong><br /><br />For many years the Lalit position on education and the use of the mother tongue  remained marginal. It was deliberately marginalized and often repressed. For  example during the National Seminar on Language organized by the MMM Government  in 1982 34 at the University of Mauritius, the organizers prohibited the Lalit  representative and others who had prepared speeches in the mother tongue, from  speaking in Kreol. They even resorted to turning microphones off when Rex Stephen,  Lalit representative was addressing the assembly.<br /><br />Not that repression discouraged us. On the contrary, we became more determined,  and continued publishing leaflets, posters, newspapers, books, magazines, program  in Kreol. We have even set up a website with a lot of text in Kreol. No one  would deny that Kreol has made immense progress 35. It has made progress not  only for itself, but also for freedom. Today Kreol is used in all kinds of diverse  places: in ads, in stand-up comedy, in literature, in films and television serials,  on posters, in theatre, in the Courts of Justice, in dictionaries and on banners  36 . Even boat skippers now have an examination in Kreol. Policemen in the UK  can pass a written exam in Kreol, in order to get overtime jobs as translator  in the Courts when Mauritians whose English isnât too good are called  as witnesses. Many Ministries use written Kreol. Bosses have used it for their  Codes of Ethics, and any number of other campaigns. LPT even has a Unit especially  for translating all kinds of texts into Kreol, or perfecting someoneâs  orthography. And today thousands of people accept the importance of the mother  tongue as medium.<br /><br />The publication in 2005 of a standardized orthography, âGrafi Larmoniâ,  is part of this ongoing progress. This makes introduction of Kreol in schools  much easier for people to imagine. All this progress is certainly in part due  to the relentless political pressure that Lalit has built up, together with  numerous associations and movements in favour of Kreol and Bhojpuri 38. This  struggle will continue until the mother tongues get full recognition, in school,  and in society as a whole.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Institutional divisions amongst children</strong><br /><br />Historically, the Catholic Church has had an important role within the national  education system, and this has had two contradictory effects: a positive contribution  in terms of developing the system, and also a potentially, and often real, source  of division amongst pupils, on the basis or race, religion and class. These  divisions have been accentuated by the ambient communalism in society as a whole.<br /><br />Prior to the Churchâs opposition to the Government Notice (GN) 114 39  , it had been implicitly, and even explicitly, accepted that the Churchâs  schools were a part of the national education system. During the course of the  battle over GN 114, the Church relied on an argument to the effect that it had  a âspecificâ type of education that it dispensed in its schools,  and this position, then contributed to a long-lasting and destructive battle  between Church, State and others, against the general back-ground of a country  fraught with communal, language and class tensions. When Education Minister,  Armoogum Parsooramen in the MMM-MSM Government set up two Select Committees  40 (with Madun Dulloo as President of one and Jean Claude de LâEstrac  as President of the other), this further communalized debate from 1993 onwards.  The two Select Committees were equivalent to the State offering a kind of trade-off  between two very unlike objects: âOriental languages being counted for  CPE examination resultsâ v/s âThe Catholic Church being able to  keep 50% of its places for its own choice of pupilsâ especially relevant  for its âstar schoolsâ (i.e. not off the national list). This Government  decision put the communalists of two âcommunitiesâ on head-on collision  course, and a number of collisions took place, both in mass mobilization on  a communal basis, and also in Supreme Court litigation. In the first round the  Church side gained important victories, so the barter seemed unfair. Then when  Suttyhudeo Tengur of the Government Hindi Teachersâ Union took cases on  appeal to the Privy Council in London, his side won both halves of the barter.<br /><br />When S. Tengur finally won his victory and the Oriental languages could be counted  for the purposes of CPE ranking (an eminently reasonable decision), then the  MMM-MSM Plan that Obeegadoo came up with was one that aimed to âescape  crisis by fleeing forwardsâ (also a good thing). He abolished ranking  for CPE altogether. However, it was also rather normal that the supporters of  S. Tengur should be angry, because their victory after years of struggle was  suddenly a Pyrric one. So that the Gokhool Plan was finally seen by people on  the S. Tengur side as being a way of salvaging some of their victory. In addition,  they knew that many who had been in favour of competition before and who are  in favour of competition in all other aspects of life, were suddenly very against  the competition around the A+. So, around S. Tengur were people who found themselves  opposing progressive measures, not so much because they were against them, but  due to the weight of history around the issues. And they are not without reason  in questioning the credibility of some of those who are so thoroughly against  the A+.<br /><br />So, the Gokhool Plan got a bit of much-needed support for a while from the reaction  against a whole history of elitism that had ruined all rational debate, even  more so after the 1993 Select Committees were set up.<br /><br />The challenge before us today is to transcend all these weighty, past sources  of division.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Failure of schools to teach literacy</strong><br /><br />Literacy is obviously key to all education. Reading and writing are skills that  children have to learn, and be taught, quite consciously. This may seem self-evident,  but many people confuse the acquisition of language and of literacy. Languages  are acquired naturally when they are in the home and the environment, while  literacy must be taught. So, the education system has a specific duty to impart  literacy to children. In addition, it is also important that adults learn to  read and write, when in Mauritius some half of people over 12 years old canât  read nor write according to the UNESCO quite restrictive definition.<br /><br />We would like here to include a very brief outline of the thinking behind Lalitâs  giving so much importance to literacy. We realize that as a person learns to  read and write, he or she is also learning to put thoughts and words that were  part of them, out there into the world 41 . This process then, in turn, contributes  to oneâs ability to learn to think in an organized way, to be able to  analyze oneâs own and othersâ thoughts. Language, once in written  form, is not just for communication, but intrinsically linked with learning  to understand the world. We develop a new capacity, which we cannot develop  very far very easily without literacy. We learn a new language proficiency altogether,  not just ordinary interpersonal communication 42 skills. Knowledge, science,  analysis, intellectual creativity, all of this develops through this new capacity  to handle language at a high level, a level that surpasses that of daily communication.<br /><br />In schools in Mauritius, unfortunately this capacity to handle language at a  high level is not developed at all. We go through primary, secondary and tertiary  education, without developing this high level language proficiency. We just  learn enough reading and writing for daily communication. Taken together with  suppression of the natural language of the child in the education system, this  actually stunts the development of high-level language proficiency. In fact,  our LPT colleagues tell us that adult literacy students who have never been  to school almost inevitably have better developed language skills than those  who have been to school for six or seven years.<br /><br />The concept that we have two different language skills (one for ordinary communication,  and another for cognitive academic development that is linked to literacy),  in turn, has further significance for us in Lalit. It is through intellectual  work on the part of large masses of people in any given society that permits  them to be able to challenge the dominant ideology 43 , which keeps such a huge  majority of people living under the yoke of others. If the broad masses are  not increasingly conscious, that is to say that all of us are not in a process  of increasingly understanding quite abstract concepts, then it is not easy for  people to understand and contribute to the kind of common understanding of the  way in which we can change society that is a necessary precondition to changing  it.<br /><br />If now we take this idea together with Paolo Freireâs idea that literacy  (adult literacy, and also that of children), if the process works well, is a  process of reading the world, not just the word, and of writing a new world,  not just taking other peoplesâ words at face value. Literacy is not just  reading words, but understanding the world by means of working with ideas about  the world 44 . While an adult is learning, there is a process whereby he or  she also, at the same time, teaches the teacher new ways of seeing the world,  thus multiplying the learning experience.<br /><br />Literacy as it is taught in schools, even more so when it is in a language the  child does not understand, is an extremely minimal skill. It does not involve  the liberation that true literacy brings.<br /><br />Another kind of school is possible<br /><br />Almost everyone today would express the hope that their own children be free  to express themselves at school and to grow emotionally and intellectually to  their own highest potential. Almost everyone wants their own children to get  a high level education, and when you put the question to them, you realize that,  in fact, they want that for all children, and not just their own. Lalit shares  this hope. This is what we are always working towards. This is what was also  the basis for the wonderful educationally rich projects 45 like A.S. Neilâs  46 Summerhill in England, Celestin Freinetâs 47 techniques developed in  France, Paolo Freireâs 48 literacy in Brazil and Chili, and even before  them Maria Montessoriâs 49 methods developed in Italy and which have become  standard in all the best pre-primaries in the world.<br /><br />In Mauritius, alternative kinds of education have been developed by the Lekol  Koperativ 50, (secondary level), Ledikasyon pu Travayer 51 (adult literacy level),  Playgroup 52 (pre-primary level), Bambous Health Project 53 (at the level of  health education, preventive medicine, and conceptualization of the body), Muvman  Liberasyon Fam 54 (womenâs biology and concepts around patriarchy). And  in turn, these organizations have relied on the experience of other pedagogies,  and then developed new forms. All of these are an inspiration for future pedagogy.  They represent the beginnings of an alternative pedagogy for Mauritius.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Vision</strong><br /><br /> For us in Lalit, education ought to mean none other than the full development  of all children. Every child has potential. The school has a duty to enable  its fulfillment, in intellectual and physical terms, as well as in terms of  emotional development.<br /><br />Education should also mean the freedom to learn. The first freedom is that of  learning through your mother tongue, the language you use naturally, and not  through the imposition of a language you are not comfortable in 55.<br /><br />Education, at its most basic, means children learning to read, write and use  figures. But it means more than this. It means the development of the love of  reading. Children need to have the love of books fostered in them from an early  age. The love of writing, of writing oneâs own thoughts, is a separate  and important aspect of literacy. It too must be nurtured in all children.<br /><br />Education also means the full development of the potential humans have for the  logical and the rational. It means acquiring scientific method. Weâd like  education to involve children in thinking and understanding, in being able to  be proficient in mathematics, in comprehending cause and effect, and knowing  of unintended effects, and dialectics. A love of science, of the history of  the universe, of our planet earth, of all that lives upon it, and of the history  of humanity, as well as the history of our own country, Mauritius, and how our  own bodies, minds and emotions work. This way children will understand health  and illness. Learning science and maths is interesting to some children only  when learnt through games like, say, chess, through lab experiments, or even  calculations based on football, if thatâs what motivates some kids.<br /><br />The celebration of Albert Einstein ...
