	<h1><h1>âDiego Committeeâ sends Open Letter to Jeremy Corbyn re Chagos Resolution</h1><p class="subtitle">01.08.2017</p></h1>
	<p class="newsarticle"><div class="WordSection1"><br /><p>âThe Diego Committeeâ that LALIT is a member of has sent an Open Letter to British Labour Party Leader for him to take a stand on the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on Britainâs excision of Chagos and banning of Mauritians, including Chagossians, from the Islands that are part of Mauritius. The letter has been co-signed by Former President of the Republic of Mauritius, Mr. Cassam Uteem, and also by former Attorney General, Jean-Claude Bibi. The organizations that form part of the Diego Committee are the Muvman Liberasyon Fam, the Muvman pu Progre Ros Bwa, the Confederation Travailleurs Secteur PrivÃ© and LALIT, while individuals are also members. âThe Diego Committeeâ was set up after the First LALIT International Action Conference in 2010. Its name was never âchosenâ but gradually emerged. For the record, the late Lindsay Aza was one of the key founder-members of the Committee, when the Baie du Tombeau Village Council members were a driving force of the Committee.</p><br /><p>Â Here is the letter, which is also being sent to all Opposition MPs in the UK, starting with the 17 who have already taken a fine stand.</p><br /><p>Â To: Hon Mr. Jeremy Corbyn</p><br /><p>Leader of the Opposition Labour Party,</p><br /><p>UK House of Commons, London.</p><br /><p>Â 31 July, 2017</p><br /><p>Â </p><br /><p>Â Dear Sir,</p><br /><p>Â We write to ask you to consider making public the Labour Partyâs stand on an international issue that British Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Minister Boris Johnson took a rather colonial position on. We refer to the UN General Assembly of 22 June 2017.</p><br /><p>Â That day, a Resolution proposed by the African union called for the UN <em>International Court of Justice</em> at The Hague, to give an Advisory Opinion on a question about the decolonization of Africa <sup>(i)</sup>. In particular, for the ICJ to give its opinion on the legality of Britainâs actions:</p><br /><p>Â Â  a) in 1965 dismembering its colony Mauritius, three years before its Independence, andÂ Â </p><br /><p>Â  b) later banning Mauritians, including Chagossians, from the Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia.</p><br /><p>Â The background geo-political reality was as follows:</p><br /><p>Â Britain, as its empire collapsed, took part in a secret plot with the USA, to âacquire Islandsâ so that the US could set up a military base beyond any social control. The UK, to do this, defied logic and international law, and cut its colony Mauritius in two, prior to Independence, keeping 60 Islands, the Chagos. It stole the Islands behind the backs of the British people, using the archaic instrument, a <em>Queenâs Order in Council</em>. It also âdepopulatedâ the stolen territory, forcibly removing the people on these outer Islands to the main Island. It did this by another <em>Queenâs Order in Council.</em> Then the receiver of stolen goods, the USA, went ahead and built and ran its surreptitiously planned military base <em>behind the backs of the peoples</em> of the USA, the UK and Mauritius.</p><br /><p>Â The Mauritian State, confident after having in 2015 won its case against Britain at the Tribunal under the <em>UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</em> for the <em>Marine Protected Area</em> set up alongside the Diego Garcia military base, and always under constant pressure from Mauritian people like ourselves, decided eventually to go through the UN General Assembly to the ICJ. The official Mauritian delegation included the Chagos Refugees Group represented by Olivier Bancoult.</p><br /><p>Â The African union took the lead, actually presenting the 22 June Resolution.</p><br /><p>Â Conservative UK Governmentâs position</p><br /><p>Here are the facts of the Conservative Governmentâs stand at the UN General Assembly of 22 June:</p><br /><p>Â 1. The Theresa May Government voted against the U.N. Resolution that requests an âAdvisory Opinionâ from the U.N. Court. As the Representative of Kenya put it, what could be âso unpalatableâ about that?</p><br /><p>So, this open letter is to ask: <em>How would Labour have voted?</em></p><br /><p>Â 2. The arguments put forward by the UK Representative were retrograde, even bizarre, and full of thinly veiled threats and bribes to the Mauritian Government and to Chagossians. Here are three points from his speech.</p><br /><p>Â a) He pretended that the Resolution was not proposed by the African union at all. Whereas in actual fact, in the real world, the African union Representative stood up and <em>presented</em> the Resolution âlive and directâ at the UN General Assembly <sup>(ii)</sup>. The UK did not <em>argue against what the African union representative said</em> but pretended he had never addressed the Assembly. Is this not a prolongation of colonial <em>Terra Nulla</em>, when Africa, all its 54 countries, puts forward a Resolution at the UN, and then this just <em>does not exist</em> for the UK Representative?</p><br /><p><em>Does Labour agree with this speech by the UK Representative?</em></p><br /><p>Â b) He claimed that the issue is not about de-colonization at all. It is a mere border dispute between any old two countries. But, as it happens, this, too, is not a question of opinion but of fact. It <em>is</em> about de-colonization, and it is known to be. A UN Resolution even warned Britain <em>against</em> it. In December 1965 the Assembly <em>âinvites the administering Power [Great Britain] to take no action which would dismember the Territory of Mauritius and violate its territorial integrity</em>â. Note that none of the 117 member states at the time voted against. Curiously not even Britain!Â  <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2066%28XX%29">http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2066(XX)</a> And now the UK Representative says itâs not a question about de-colonization, when it is. Even according to Britain in 1965.</p><br /><p><em>Does Labour think the 22 June, 2017 Resolution was not about de-colonization? </em></p><br /><p>Â c) The UK Representative went so far as to pretend that the Mauritian delegation to the pre-Independence negotiations somehow <em>sold</em> Chagos, including Diego Garcia, to Britain for a sum of money in Pounds. The absurdity of this stand is clear, when you know that:</p><br /><p>Â (i) In 1965, three years before Mauritian Independence, the Head of State of Britain, the supposed buyer of the 60 Islands, was Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. At the same time, the Head of State of Mauritius, the supposed seller of the 60 Islands, was her own Royal self, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She was represented on the Mauritian side by her appointee, the Governor Sir John Rennie, who presided at the Mauritian Council of Ministers.</p><br /><p><em>Does the Labour Party think the Queen can sell parts of her colonies to herself?</em></p><br /><p>Â (ii) The delegation for negotiations was not even the Council of Ministers, as the UK Representative pretended but 4 political partiesâ leaders and a Private Sector Representative! They were the Mauritian Labour Party, the PMSD, the IFB, the CAM and Mr.Maurice Paturau for the private sector. How such a happy band could have âsoldâ a part of a country is beyond imagination. <em>Does Labour think they could? It was, of course, the Harold Wilson Labour Government that did the dirty job. This means it is urgent for Labour to correct for this in 2017. </em></p><br /><p>Â d) The UK Representative said, in paraphrase, that <em>Sovereignty over the Chagos is not up for discussion, Mauritius having already sold the Chagos to Britain for a few pounds long ago, so the UK proposes </em><em>bilateral negotiations</em>. But, what is to be discussed, then? What on earth is there to discuss other than sovereignty? Or are they offering more blood money? More bribes? More threats? <em>What is the Labour Partyâs line on this?</em></p><br /><p>Â e) The UK Representative said thatÂ <em>Britain, as if Father Christmas, intends to âcedeâ Chagos to Mauritius when it is no longer needed for defence.</em>Â Why would they ever have offered to do such a thing, if it is <em>theirs</em>? Of course, all this is just stale Colonial hot air. Because who gets to decide <em>when</em> this magic moment arrives when Diego Garcia âis no longer necessary for defence purposesâ? Imperialist pretexts are without end. Until the empire ends. At first, the military base on Diego Garcia was necessary because of the USSR. When the USSR collapsed, there was a new threat. So, second, came âto control the oil routesâ. It didnât stick long. Third, âSomalian fishermen-turned-pirates in piroguesâ became a danger to the whole of the West. Now, of course, the pretext is âterrorismâ. What can a nuclear military base like Diego Garcia do against âterroristsâ whose most recent methods include cruelly driving trucks into city crowds?<em> Does Labour find all these pretexts reasonable? </em></p><br /><p><em>Â </em>And now itâs time to come to one or two things the UK Representative did not say. He did not say that torture was carried out on Diego Garcia. He did not say that the UKâs own Commission of Inquiry on the Iraq War found that the causes given for aggression were âfar from satisfactoryâ and that Saddam Hussein had posed âno imminent threatâ. Nor that the Niger-Iraq uranium deal was based on a forgery. So, the war was illegal. Yet B-52âs took off from Diego Garcia to bombard the civilian population of Baghdad. Nor did he say <em>which people</em> have the moral responsibility for either the torture on, or the B-52s from, a bit of the planet that he wants kept beyond all democratic control i.e. Diego Garcia.</p><br /><p>Â <em>Surely Labour wants this base simply closed down and cleaned up? Surely Labour can see that the way forward is for the BIOT (the British rump colony) to be closed down. And for decolonization to be completed. This way the people of Mauritius, including all Chagossians, will be free to come and go to and from the islands that are part of Mauritius, heads held high?Â  </em></p><br /><p>We realize that Labourâs 2016 Political Program for the UK General Elections maintains that Chagossians have the right to return to a still-colonized BIOT! Here is what we read in the Labour Program:</p><br /><p>We will always stand up for the rights, interests and self-determination of Britainâs overseas territories and their citizens, whether protecting the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands against anyone who would seek to challenge it, or supporting the right of the Chagos islanders to return to their homelands.</p><br /><p>Â What we would like to see is Labour Party leaders and members considering taking a stand for:</p><br /><p>1) Britain to retreat from Chagos altogether, so that Mauritius can enjoy sovereignty on all its territory and finally be united as a country and as a people.</p><br /><p>2) Britain to stop banning Chagossians and other Mauritians from Chagos.</p><br /><p>3) The US Military base to be closed down, with a full clean-up.</p><br /><p>Â We are pleased to note that there are MPs moving in this direction already.
