Digitalization of LALIT Documentation Centre Makes Progress
05.09.2008
The huge task of creating an electronic form of the entire LALIT documentation Centre continues apace. LALIT's documentation centre includes, amongst other things, a vast selection of carefully chosen cuttings from the Mauritian press over the past 30 years, and classified into about 100 key-words. The system used is OASIS, Open Access to Symbiotic Information Storage, which is a flexible and user-friendly system.Different LALIT militants are working on different subjects, while Muvman Liberasyon Fam members are concentrating on the files concerning women's issues, and Ledikasyon pu Travayer members are working on the language and literacy files.This work, once completed, will give members easier access to the riches of the documentation centre.
