Political Education
28.09.2010
Alain Ah-Vee, LALIT member, will be giving a talk on Thursday 30 September at the LALIT headquarters in GRNW, on the differences between political work, on the one hand, and trade union and social work, on the other. He will critique the "civil society" fad that is popular in the petty-bourgeoisie at the moment.
