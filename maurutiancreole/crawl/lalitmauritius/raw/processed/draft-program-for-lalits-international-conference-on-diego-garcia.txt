Draft Program for LALIT's International Conference on Diego Garcia
07.09.2010
We have pleasure in sharing with our web visitors the draft program for our International Conference on Diego Garcia to be held at the end of October in Port Louis, Mauritius. Anyone wanting to get an invitation, please contact LALIT. You will notice that the theme/s and the speakers will make the Conference a very important one. The timing, too, is key.The Diego Garcia military base issue is firmly on the world political agenda at the present moment in history. The British "lease" to the US of the stolen Islands comes up for renewal in the 2014-16 period, that is to say the newly elected British and Mauritian governments will be under enormous pressure from the US, as well as being subservient under their own steam. As if in preparation for political problems, the British Government has gone ahead and declared a "Marine Protected Area" around the Mauritian Islands it illegally occupies, and has successfully conned many large environmental organizations into supporting this outrageous scheme. In October, the European Union Human Rights Court is to hear the appeal for the Chagossians right to return against the British Government, which has recently announced it will fight the appeal tooth and nail. Last year the British Government was finally forced to change its story and to admit that there had been illegal renditions on Diego Garcia in the supposed war on terror. The UN Treaty for an Africa Free of Nuclear Arms (Penlindaba Treaty) which has come into force as from last year has opened up a chance for the Mauritian Government to call for UN IAEA inspections. All these reasons explain why LALIT has chosen to hold the Conference now. This struggle, like all others, depends on the balance of forces and every bit of support changes these. This is more than ever true in times of great economic turmoil, when capitalism is particularly unstable.This particular question refuses to leave the agenda, however much the US and UK have tried to keep it veiled. It is a question that seems to draw together so many themes and struggles, and to interconnect them: decolonization, anti-militarism, anti-nuclear, the environment and ecological issues, the women's struggle (women have been at the forefront of this struggle in Mauritius for decades), the anti-war movement as a whole, the "No Bases movement", anti-imperialism, and of course, all the economic issues that underpin all of this.
