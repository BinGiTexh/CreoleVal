Peadar King, Irish film-maker, in Solidarity
08.11.2010
I first heard of and was deeply moved by the story of the people of the Chagos islands in an article written by Lindsey Collen in the New Internationalist. That article inspired me to make a film on the gross violation of the rights of the Chagosian people and we were very privileged to be able to do so in November 2007.  All of us who worked on that film, Jerry O'Callaghan, Mick Cassidy, Mick O'Rourke, RÃ³nÃ¡n Ã Muirgheasa and myself were deeply touched by the extraordinary bravery, the dignity and sheer determination of Lindsey Collen, Aurelie Talate, Anncy  Jaffar, Fernand Mandarin, Olivier Bancoult, Rita Bancoult, Rajsoomer Lallah, Rosemond  Saminaden and Felicie Mandarin who were gracious in giving us their time and privileging us with their stories.  We continue to follow your just campaign with interest, we wish you well in your conference and we hope that your undeniable right to your homeland will some day soon be vindicated. In solidarity, Peadar King
