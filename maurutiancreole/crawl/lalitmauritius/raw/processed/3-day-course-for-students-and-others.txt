3-Day Course for Students and Others
25.07.2011
LALIT invites applications for its 3-day political education program starting 27 July 2011. Read the program below, and if you are interested, you can e-mail us at lalitmail@intnet.mu or telephone us on 208 2132 or 208 5551 for details and to book a place. The course is free. There are no tests, and no certificates. It is learning for the sake of gaining knowledge and for understanding ways of understanding the world. This means the course contains what at university is studied under the headings of sociology, media studies, political science, ecology, history, but where we share this knowledge and understanding of the world around us with a view to understanding it so well that we can help to change it. People giving the courses also often follow the sessions being given by their peers.

For people coming by bus, get off on the GRNW bridge, and walking back towards Port Louis it is fourth building on the side of the sea, just opposite the Dojon hillock. For those coming by motorcycle, you can park in the yard, for those coming by car, the Authorities have unwittingly given LALIT a parking spot, just across the road (by cancelling the newly created bus stop) and there is parking in the Debarcadere Rd alongside the Le Defi building.
