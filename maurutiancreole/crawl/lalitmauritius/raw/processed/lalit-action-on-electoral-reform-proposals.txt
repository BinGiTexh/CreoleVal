LALIT action on Electoral Reform proposals
17.08.2010
LALIT has sent all the Members of the National Assembly a copy of its proposals on Electoral Reform. Many MPs have already replied that they are reading the documents. This LALIT action is sharp contrast with the Prime Minister`s vague proposal to set up a "Committee of experts" in order to come up with proposals.The Electoral Supervisory Commission has also received a copy of the LALIT proposals.(See our Document Section for a copy in English)
