LALIT retrospective 2005: ANTI-REPRESSION: Lalit leaders totally cleared of trumped-up charges
01.01.2006
The two Lalit members who had trumped up charges laid against them after the incident of police officers spying on the NO TO BUSH's POLICIES common front meeting before the AGOA forum, were finally totally cleared of charges in 2005. These charges were laid soon after Paul Berenger became Prime Minister around an incident that had taken place a year earlier.
