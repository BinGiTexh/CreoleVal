Aneerood Jugnauth Government dissolved, New Government Sworn In
24.01.2017
Â Yesterday, 24 January, 2017, Aneerood Jugnauth dissolved his Cabinet, and the President of the Republic Amina Gurrib-Fakim swore in Pravind Jugnauth, who in her own deliberate judgement âcan command the support of a majority of the members of the Assemblyâ (1).Â Then Pravind Jugnauth formed a new Government.Â Each Minister was sworn in. Aneerood Jugnauth has taken on the Lee Kwan Yu role of âMinister Mentorâ, and is number three in Government after Ivan Collendavelloo of the Muvman Liberater.Â Surprises were that Roshi Bhadain just didnât turn up; he has been sulking for a while as he has gradually been given less and less responsibility, and he seems to have surprised his colleagues by his theatrical gesture of just not showing up for the ceremony.Â Ms. Marie-Claire Monty, who resigned from the PMSD when it left Government, was thought to have perhaps been in the running for a Ministry, but was not named. Anil Gayan is the new Tourism Minister, transferred from Health where he had, after a very destructive start, just begun to take on head-on the vested interests that tend to run down Government services (specialists who also do private practice); this is not a good sign.Â Taken as a whole, the Cabinet, however, is not much different from the previous one, and how could it be. So, we can expect the very same lack of a proper strategy to re-launch production and in particular job creation in production; we can expect, unless we protest against it, a continuation of the selling off of good arable land in real estate, including a form of neo-colonization a-la-Israelienne. So, LALIT will have to continue protesting against this new Government and coming up with programmatic challenges.Â Here is the list of new Ministers:Â Prime Minister Â  Â  Â  Pravind JugnauthVice PMÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Ivan CollendavellooMinister Mentor Â  Â  Â  Aneerood JugnauthVPM & Housing Â  Â  Â  Shawkutally SoodhunForeign Aff.
