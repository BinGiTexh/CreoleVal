New Anti-Terrorism Legislation Threatened in Jamaica: LALIT supports those opposing the Bill
15.12.2003
An Ad Hoc Committee has been set up in Jamaica to oppose the Government's new Anti-Terrorist Bill, a draconian draft legislation now in Parliament there. The Opposition Party is also opposing the Bill. Contacted by members of the Committee, LALIT has sent copies of many of the documents that we produced here against the Mauritian Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2000. In Mauritius the opposition to the Bill was strong and generalized enough to cause the resignation of two Presidents of the Republic, who refused to sign the anti-human rights Bill to make it become law. Only then did the Chief Justice in a much-criticized act, sign the terrible law.
