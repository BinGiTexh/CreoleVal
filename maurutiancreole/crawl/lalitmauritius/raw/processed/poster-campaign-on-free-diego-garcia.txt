Poster campaign on "Free Diego Garcia"
18.10.2010
LALIT members yesterday launched a campaign of posters with the slogan "Free Diego", "Diego" being the short form for the Diego Garcia Island, part of the Chagos Archipelago. These posters form part of the campaign to free the Chagos from British colonialism, from US military presence and for the right to return for all Chagossians. Posters in bright yellow, bright red and black have been pasted up in many parts of the country.
