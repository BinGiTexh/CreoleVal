In the 60th anniversary year of the IMF and World Bank, we demand the following measures from the institutions and the government which control them. Add your voice by endorsing  these demands:- Open all World Bank and IMF meetings to the medias and the public;- Cancel all impoverished country debt to the world Bank and IMF, using the institutions' own resources- End all World Bank and IMF policies that hinder people's access to food, clean water, shelter, health care, education, and right to organize. )such "structural adjustment" policies include user fees, privatisation and economic austerity programs)- Stop all World Bank support for socially and environmentally destructive projects such as oil, gas and mining activities, and all support for projects such as dams that include forced relocation of people. We furthermore recognize the urgency of the world's most catastrophic health crisis, the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We assert the culpability of the international financial institutions in declining health care systems of Global South countries, reject the approach of fighting the pandemic with more loans and conditions from these institutions. We call on the world's governments to best deploy their resources by fully funding the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. We demand the elimination of trade rules that undermine access to affordable life-saving medications.
