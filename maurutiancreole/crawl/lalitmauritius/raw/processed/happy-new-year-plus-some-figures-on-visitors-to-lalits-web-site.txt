02.01.2018
We would like to extend our warm New Yearâs wishes from everyone at LALIT to all our web site visitors. And we would like to call on your to send us an e-mail addressed to lalitmail@intnet.mu to give us an idea of what you appreciate, and whether you would like to help in any way.Â Here are some figures to give an idea of the continuous upward trend in the numbers of visitors to our site. Starting with hundreds, moving on to thousands, tens of thousands, and getting beyond hundreds of thousands. You will notice that in some years, there is a trend towards exponential growth, followed by a stabilization, and then exponential growth again. The last three years have settled around the 1.5 million hits per year mark.2002Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â 2422003Â Â  Â Â Â Â 17,1612004Â Â  Â Â Â Â 64,1572005Â  Â Â Â 103,8012006 Â Â Â Â 152,5592007Â  Â Â Â 111,5692008Â Â  Â Â 147,3952009Â  Â Â Â 264,3252010Â  Â Â Â 422,247Â 2011Â  Â Â Â 376,3472012Â  Â Â Â 362,4012013 Â  Â Â 581,7452014Â Â  Â Â 900,000 Â Â Â Â (Estimate based on real figures for most individual months)2015Â Â  1,400,000 Â Â Â (Estimate based on real figures for most individual months)2016Â Â  1,744,2272017Â Â  1,563,343Â TOTAL over the 16 years: 8,211,519
