To coincide with the launch of the new China Economic, Trade and Co-operation Zone at Riche Terre, now called the Jin Fei project, LALIT's Thursday political education session on 24 September will be on China. In particular it will deal with the development of the capitalist economy and class forces, since 1970. Rada Kistnasamy will be delivering it. This follows a previous session, last year, on a similar theme given by Ragini Kistnasamy. With the huge new development of this Zone in Mauritius set up with Chinese private capital originally, now after the economic crisis with the help of two Provincial government's capital, the shape of the Mauritian economy can be expected to  change somewhat.
