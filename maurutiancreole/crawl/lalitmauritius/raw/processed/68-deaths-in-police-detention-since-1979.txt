Yesterday, in the Radio-Plus debate after the 4.30pm news, in the context of the Court judgement that did not condemn police officers charged with torturing Mr. Iqbal Toofany who died in police custody with 14 injuries, LALIT member Lindsey Collen spoke of what must be done to curb police torture.She explained that there are systemic changes needed to. As it is, police officers torture detainees to extricate a âconfessionâ from them. Once this confession is obtained, there is no case: there is only a Court sentence based on the confession. Section 75 of the Criminal Code states: "Accused admitting charge: Where the accused admits the charge to be true, his confession shall be recorded, and judgment delivered according to law." In LALIT's experience, when police officers torture people they have detained, they do so either to obtain a confession to a criminal charge, or to get a statement incriminating someone else.Â Readers can read more about LALIT's proposals on this confession law through this link:https://www.lalitmauritius.org/en/newsarticle/730/lalit-proposes-measures-to-end-torture-of-detainees/Lindsey Collen also explained the need for protocols for differentÂ corps de metiersÂ to ensure that professionals do not become accomplices to police cover-ups when detainees are tortured in their custody.
