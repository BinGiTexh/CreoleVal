Whatever happened to Rao Rama?
12.01.2015
The disappearance of Rao Rama seems to be a State Secret. While all the other advisors to the last Government, plus all other hangers-on and political nominees by the barrowful, have been given front- page coverage, the destiny of Rao Rama, Prime Ministerâs man to head the National Identity Card Unit in his office, has somehow slipped into oblivion. Physically, he has evaporated. And nobody seems to even have noticed it.How on earth can this have happened? Where is he? How much public money was spent on him? What for? Since the whole central database is up for destruction, what is his responsibility in this fiasco of a project?Are there any journalists in the country who are prepared to ask relevant questions?
