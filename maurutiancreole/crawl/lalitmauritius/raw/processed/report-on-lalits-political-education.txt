Report on LALITâs Political Education
31.07.2011
31 different people, mainly young people, participated in LALITâs most recent Lekol de Kad, a three day political school held on 27, 28 and 29 July at GRNW. The highlights were short films, animated discussions, rivetting talks, role-playing, tips on speaking in public and on note-taking, tips on preparing a âpower-pointâ and using search engines. Subjects covered included class analysis, what is the âhistoric blockâ, the role of trade unions, de-colonization (not just political, but economic, social and psychological), Mauritian history in class terms, what all the political parties in Mauritius stand for, and so on.
