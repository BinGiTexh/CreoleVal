Content of Two Letters to Prime Minister Yesterday on Asbestos Housing Published
06.10.2018
LALIT has pleasure in publishing below the contents of the individual letters signed by 365 different people on behalf of their families protesting at Governmentâs delay in replacing asbestos housing. Around one half signed a second letter, their first one having been ignored by the Prime Minister, while the other half wrote informing him of who lives in their house, and with the same demands as the other letter.Â Here is the content:Â Name [of housing estate inhabitant living in asbestos house and writing to the Prime Minister for the 2nd time]: .....................................................................................Â Cite EDC in:Â  ......................................................................Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  5 October, 2018Â To the Prime Minister, Pravind Jugnauth.Â Dear Sir,Â During a protest march on 6 July, 2018 organized by the Joint Local Housing and Local LALIT Committees, I submitted a letter to you, on behalf of my family, with specific demands concerning your Governmentâs failure to put into action its âgrand projet dâenvergureâ announced by your Government in writing in 2015, and its failure to follow the specific recommendations of Dr. Sibartie and the Truth and Justice Commission to demolish and reconstruct houses made of asbestos.Â Our letters to you were polite. We called on you to announce a time-frame for the promised work, and for local/regional âdesksâ to be set up so that we can check on progress in the demolition-reconstruction work. I, with some 340 others, appointed 6 delegates to leave the letters at your office on the same day. I have waited 12 weeks. I have received no reply. You made no public statement, either. Your Ministers of the Environment and of Housing have made vague and hollow statements with a whiff of procrastination about them, while choosing apparently arbitrarily 4 EDC CitÃ© out of the 59, and while allocating the paltry sum of Rs20 million for thousands of houses or more.Â I am, like thousands of other families, in the impossible situation of being forced to live in housing sold to me by the State that I know is dangerous to me and my familyâs health, and despite assurances from the State from 2006, 2011 and 2015 that you will remedy this dangerous situation by replacing the toxic housing sold to us by the State. It is the responsibility of the State to remedy this urgently. And the State has admitted that it is its responsibility. In addition, it is dangerous for amateurs like me to dismantle this housing, anyway.Â I now wish, during a second national protest march today 5th October, 2018 to call on you, in addition to our demands specified in my last letter, to:Â 1. Reply to our letters publicly, as well as individually, announcing your timetable for replacing our houses, and where you will provide a âdeskâ for us to ascertain progress being made.2. Immediately arrange for screening for asbestos-related illnesses i.e. for tests that measure:a) breathingb) oxygen levelsc) exercise capacityd) breathing during sleepas well as scans. The cursory screening done in 2002 on a handful of people is wholly inadequate; we call for systematic and thorough screening for possible asbestos-related illness.3. Take heed of recommendations by the Ombudsperson for Children on the effects on children of living in this dangerous housing.Â We petition you again as we are the victims of what is an urgent public health issue.Â Yours sincerely,........................................Signature or thumb printName [of housing estate inhabitant living in asbestos house and writing to the Prime Minister for the 2nd time]Â ................................................................................Â Street: ...................................................................
