Playgroup Launches Thirtieth Title for children in the Mother Tongues
28.11.2012
The launch on Friday 23 November of Playgroupsâ 30th title for children, Kirouni Kirouna, represents a milestone. Number 30! Thirty childrenâs books mean the beginning of a real selection for parents and teachers for young onesâ early childhood development. Most of the books, like Kirouni Kirouna, are gloriously illustrated. They make for a wonderful mixture of the magical and the realistic, the whimsical and the down-to-earth. Many are funny. Some go with songs. Others with little sketches. All contribute to a fantastic cognitive and emotional development, in harmony with the surroundings of the child. The books are almost all in the mother tongues, Kreol and even some in Bhojpuri, which is even more oppressed than Kreol. The birth of a new childrenâs book, and it being number 30, is thus cause for celebration.Vidya Golam in his launch speech gave a profound and moving interpretation and evaluation of Kirouni Kirouna, based on the Bhojpuri original folk-tale remembered by Medha Moti from her grandfatherâs oral version, and then translated into Kreol by Henri Favory from the French text by Medha. Hans Ramduth commented formally during the launch on the beautiful illustrations by Camille Seneque. There were some 60 people present, including Playgroup parents and teachers, MIE teacher-trainers, representatives of associations and, of course, all those concerned with the creation and production of the book, and the Press. Saresh Viramally presided ably, paying homage to the late Rajsoomer Lallah who had been a constant supporter of Playgroupâs work. Shiva Tirvengadum read a poem he composed to music, as a homage to Kirouni Kirouna. People present snapped up copies for New Year presents. The book is on sale for Rs 40.The Federation of Pre-School Playgroups, was set up by Pushpa Lallah in 1974, who was joined by generations of able teachers and parents as colleagues, who worked with literally thousands of children over the years, literally all over Mauritius. Playgroup has five huge contributions to its credit, contributions that need mention at the time of the launch of their thirtieth childrenâs book, contributions so important that Playgroup will go down in the history of education in Mauritius as an important trail-blazer:Playgroup Contributions on all fronts1. Introducing playing as the best way towards cognitive development for the 3-5-year-olds in pre-schools, at a time when children were taught rote-learning in French and English, sitting on a long bench with their feet dangling in mid-air, and being taught to âekuteâ meaning being trained to be docile before being sent to Government Primary schools. (In the promotion of ludique education, they were accompanied, in the 1970s, by the Joint Child Health Project.) Play is now an integral part of pre-school education.2. Introducing Mauritian culture by making toys with whatever was available, like filao seeds, bottle tops, snail shells, and also by nurturing local games and past-times from hop-scotch, kite-making, nursery thymes, and sculpture in clay to top-spinning, paper-boat sailing, marbles and playing âshopsâ with Mauritian reality in the shelves. Playgroup has, perhaps more than any other association, given value and esteem to the social customs at the grassroots in neighbourhoods all over Mauritius. And they have promoted the mother tongues, Kreol and Bhojpuri, in both oral and written form, for all kinds of discourse and publication, as an integral part of this cultural sensitivity.3. Confronting Government policy on education politically at every level, and even winning a Supreme Court Case against the State. The Government had come up with a draft âCurriculum Planâ that just side-lined the mother-tongues, pretended they did not even exist. Playgroup challenged this, and the State backed down. Playgroup has constantly opposed the oppression by âco-operantsâ mainly from France, and they did this in committees, in the Press, and in consultations with Government; they have constantly written articles for the Press and in their newsletters on the need to make children, Mauritian children, the centre of education.4. Organizing people in âassociationsâ which ran the Playgroups in different areas, until there were some 15 âassociationsâ in the Federation. This enabled a kind of people-power in the pre-school sector, where teachers and parents in a democratic structure, ran their education. Playgroups have existed in most towns, Curepipe, Rose-Hill, Quatre Bornes and Vacoas, and in many villages, including Nouvelle France, New Grove, Bambous, La Gaulette, Surinam, Banane, Cluny, Midlands, Tamarin, Mon Choisy, Wooton, Bell Village, St. Louis, Dubreuil, St Julien Village, Gro Billot, Ecroignard, Riviere des Galets, Bel Ombre. 5. Promoting, using and developing the mother-tongues, Kreol and Bhojpuri, as the basis for a multi-lingual education. And it is this last-mentioned contribution that we will go into in detail on today: Promoting, using and developing the mother-tongues, Mauritian Kreol and Bhojpuri.Playgroup Promotion of the Mother-Tongues as the base for Multilingual EducationWhat other organization than Playgroup has produced bilingual books by the dozen for the children of Mauritius?What other organization than Playgroup has produced quadrilingual books?

What other education organization has raised parentsâ consciousness about education and language issues, constantly for 38 years, other than Playgroup?What other organization has published story books for children that educate them on local issues, like stopping the proliferation of mosquitoes, planting seeds, Mauritius being a âRepublicâ with many islands not just âLil Morisâ as if it were a single-island state, how to make a kite, how to check if you are annoying someone, different âstatesâ like sulking, being preoccupied, being unsure of oneself, and so on?What other organization has created, published and distributed 30 titles for children?
