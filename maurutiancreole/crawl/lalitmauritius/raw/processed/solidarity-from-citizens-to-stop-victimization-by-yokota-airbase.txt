Solidarity from Citizens to Stop Victimization by Yokota Airbase
09.11.2010
We admire Chagossians' struggle. We must not allow the US to occupy foreign lands as part of its world strategy. Our movement is aimed at getting rid of sufferings caused by the US Yokota Airbase in Tokyo, the capital city of Japan. The root cause of our sufferings is, just as is the case in Diego Garcia, the presence of US military forces that have unduly refused to go home. In that sense, we need to engage in a common struggle to solve our shared problem. We hope the International Conference for Action may be successful.Citizens to Stop Victimization by Yokota Airbase
