Are there any formalities we have to undertake, relative to your Ministry, in order to travel to any island of the Chagos Archipelago? We know how to visit Rodrigues, Agalega, Ile aux Cerfs or how to do some camping on Ile de la Passe, but we are not sure if there is any specific official formality we have to fill in at your Ministry for our planned visit to the Chagos. Furthermore, the newly voted .Local Government Act .has rightly re-confirmed, if need be, Mauritian sovereignty on the Chagos Archipelago, in affirming your power as Minister in charge of all local authorities to establish regional bodies in all islands of the Republic of Mauritius including the Chagos.
