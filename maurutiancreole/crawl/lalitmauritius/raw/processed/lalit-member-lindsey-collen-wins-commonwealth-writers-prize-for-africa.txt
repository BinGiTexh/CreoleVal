02.02.2005
Lindsey Collen has just received the good news that she has won the Commonwealth Prize for Africa for her novel "Boy". Ten years ago, in 1994, she won Commonwealth Writers Prize for Africa for her novel "The Rape of Sita".  The Rape of Sita was also longlisted for the 1996 Orange Prize.Her novels are beautifully written novels that are entrenched in Mauritian reality. Her novel "Mutiny" captures the atmosphere of the February 1999 revolt in Mauritius, triggered by the death of famous singer Kaya in Alcatraz police cell. She had written the novel well before the revolt! Lalit celebrates this great event with her.
