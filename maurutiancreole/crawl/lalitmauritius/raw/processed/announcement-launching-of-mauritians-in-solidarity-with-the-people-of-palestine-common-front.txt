30.12.2020
ANNOUNCEMENTNew Common Front Formed in Mauritius: “Mauritians in Solidarity with the People of Palestine, No to Israeli Apartheid!”At this year’s end, we are pleased to announce that 10 organizations and 42 individuals have come together to launch a new common front. It is called Mauritians in Solidarity with the People of Palestine: No to Israeli Apartheid! ((SOMALP) An updated founder members’ list below, as of 30 December, 2020.SOMALP is being born in a new context for the people of Palestine. President Donald Trump of the USA has made common cause with Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel – with the aim of, at one and the same time, dominating the people of Palestine and “normalizing” Israel’s relations with the Arab world, that is to say with traditional “allies” of the Palestinians.  Strangely, it is also a time of hope. The Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions (BDS) world-wide movement has isolated Israel, and will continue to do so as long as Israel occupies Palestine illegally. In the USA, Israel’s main ally, a great deal of support for the Palestinian people has begun to be expressed, and for the first time, big organizations of Jewish people are opposing the Israeli aggression and expansion.  And in this context of both new challenges and new hopes, all over the world a new counter-offensive is taking the form of a struggle to get the Israeli state declared an “Apartheid State” – Apartheid having, since 1966, been declared a crime against humanity by the United Nations. It is in this context that our new common front, SOMALP, is being born in Mauritius. It was in this new context that on Saturday 28 November SOMALP’s birth was planned. A resolution was taken at a gathering, at which there were talks on the new situation, and then a candlelight vigil on the Royal Road in Grand River North West in Port Louis. It was also resolved that the previous BDS committee will now be “subsumed” into SOMALP.  List of Founder OrganizationsConfederation of General Trade unions (Vinod Seegum)                      Confederation des Travailleurs des Secteurs Publique et Privé (Reeaz Chuttoo)Mauritius Labour Congress (Haniff Peerun)All Workers’ Federation (Haniff Peerun)        Federation of Parastatal Bodies and Other union (Deepak Benydin)Dr. Idrice Goomany Treatment Centre (Samad Abdus Dulloo)           Consumer Advocacy Platform (Mosadeq Sahebdin)Chagos Refugees Group (Olivier Bancoult)Muvman Liberasyon Fam (Ragini Kistnasamy)LALIT (Alain Ah Vee)List of individual Founder Members Cassam Uteem, Former President of the Republic of MauritiusRama Poonoosamy, Former Minister of Arts and CultureVinesh Hookoomsing, Former Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of MauritiusJean-Claude Bibi, Former Attorney GeneralandRagini KistnasamyFiroza Dilmohamed Kavi PyneeandyGopalen ChellapermalClement BordelaisRehza Khan Norman TambanivoulKhalid GareebunAlain FanchonMarie Ange FanchonGary HometRajendra RamenAmyot PerrineDanny Le Merle Ahmad TallyballyRada KistnasamyRajni LallahImran DhanooAlain Ah Vee Sudha Ramen Francis JolicoeurLaval YvesChristian BatourRashid DenmanodeAudrey NoelAnouchka Cindy Clelie Anne-Marie Joly Sultana Begum Budulla Anne-Marie HypoliteAbdool NabeeAkshay SeepargauthPushpa Lallah Georges Herchenroder Nuhaa TallyballyNabiilah TallyballyLindsey CollenRam SeegobinRoland Fozoo updated on 30 Dec 2020 at 7:37 pm
ANNOUNCEMENT
New Common Front Formed in Mauritius: 
“Mauritians in Solidarity with the People of Palestine, 
No to Israeli Apartheid!”
At this year’s end, we are pleased to announce that 10 organizations and 42 individuals have come together to launch a new common front. It is called Mauritians in Solidarity with the People of Palestine: No to Israeli Apartheid! ((SOMALP) An updated founder members’ list below, as of 30 December, 2020.
SOMALP is being born in a new context for the people of Palestine. President Donald Trump of the USA has made common cause with Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel – with the aim of, at one and the same time, dominating the people of Palestine and “normalizing” Israel’s relations with the Arab world, that is to say with traditional “allies” of the Palestinians.  
Strangely, it is also a time of hope. The Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions (BDS) world-wide movement has isolated Israel, and will continue to do so as long as Israel occupies Palestine illegally. In the USA, Israel’s main ally, a great deal of support for the Palestinian people has begun to be expressed, and for the first time, big organizations of Jewish people are opposing the Israeli aggression and expansion.  
And in this context of both new challenges and new hopes, all over the world a new counter-offensive is taking the form of a struggle to get the Israeli state declared an “Apartheid State” – Apartheid having, since 1966, been declared a crime against humanity by the United Nations. It is in this context that our new common front, SOMALP, is being born in Mauritius. 
It was in this new context that on Saturday 28 November SOMALP’s birth was planned. A resolution was taken at a gathering, at which there were talks on the new situation, and then a candlelight vigil on the Royal Road in Grand River North West in Port Louis. It was also resolved that the previous BDS committee will now be “subsumed” into SOMALP.
