LALIT notes that the recent Muvman Liberasyon Fam accentuation of the struggle has had a direct effect on the issue.Here is what the Cabinet has published on the Government website: "Cabinet has agreed to the introduction into the National Assembly of the Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill which amends the Criminal Code to authorize the termination of pregnancy in specified circumstances, namely, in cases where â(a) the continued pregnancy will endanger the pregnant personâs life;(b) the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant person;(c) there is a substantial risk that the continued pregnancy will result in a severe malformation, or severe physical or mental abnormality, of the foetus, as assessed by the appropriate specialists; and(d) the pregnancy has not exceeded its fourteenth week and results from a case of rape, sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 16 or sexual intercourse with a specified person which has been reported to the police or a medical practitioner."
