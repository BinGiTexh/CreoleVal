21.01.2010
One of LALIT's leading members, Alain Ah-Vee, is in India for the Conference against War being held from today 22 January 2010 in Ahmedabad, and which is organized by the War Resisters International together with anti-war organizations in India. The conference will be opened today with speeches by activist and novelist, Arundhati Roy and renowned intellectual, Ashish Nandy. Tomorrow Alain Ah-Vee will be amongst those presenting papers on military bases; he will concentrate on Diego Garcia, its effects on the people who were living there, on carving up territory as an illegal condition for Mauritian Independence, and on the struggle to get the base closed down.People will be coming from some 30 countries. Most are to stay at a University campus, while others will stay with local organizations involved in hosting the conference, including Gandhian organizations and the Institute for Total Revolution.Alain Ah-Vee will be staying with the family of one of the members of one of these organizations. After arriving by air in Mumbai yesterday, he and six other participants arriving on the same day, together got themselves to the Rail Station to take the five-hour train journey to Ahmedabad.The main aim of the Conference to link the anti-war movement with the livelihood of people and groups of people. This includes the displacement, dis-employment, and dispossession of people in relative small local conflicts, and also the monstrous international wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Congo, Somalia, and identifying the links between the wars, while building alliances that are both local and global at the same time. The aim is to both resist war, expose profiteering, oppose military bases, on the one hand, and also create and care for livelihoods of people, on the other.PROGRAMMEDAY 1: OPENING SESSION   Welcome from Sudershan Iyengar, vice-chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith.
