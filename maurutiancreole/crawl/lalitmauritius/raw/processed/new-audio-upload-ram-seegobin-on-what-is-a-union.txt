New audio upload: Ram Seegobin on âWhat is a union?â
17.05.2011
This audio extract is taken from LALIT's political education session for all those interested to join LALIT that was held in 2010. In these times where there is a lot of debate on tension and conflict between different trade union bureaucracies, debate on the degeneration of trade union bureaucracy in the absence of working class mobilisation, it is refreshing to revisit the real meaning of âunionâ and of its beginnings in history.The audio extract is in the Kreol language, in its original version.
