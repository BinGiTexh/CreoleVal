LALIT replies to Democracy Watch Mauritius (DWM)
17.03.2012
In its 15 March Bulletin, DWM reacts to the content of the LALIT Strategy Conference of  12 March. The DWM reaction is based on the article that Deepa Bhookhun wrote on the conference, and the DWM reaction is entitled: âLa lutte des classes menace lâunitÃ© nationale.â They also mention the LâExpress title âDangereux le mauricianisme? â We cannot imagine where the newspaper got this title from.The DWM congratulates LALIT for having organised this conference on the theme:  âLe mauricianisme encourage le communalismeâ. So DWM attributes the wrong theme to our conference, a theme that the newspaper invented, for reasons of its own.The theme of our conference was announced at a press conference on Wednesday 7 March, and it was on the printed program that all participants received:âIs it really mauritianism that can combat communalism?âIs it really nationalism that can combat imperialism?âThe aim of the conference which was very well attended, was to analyse critically  the strategies that had been used in the past to struggle against communalism and imperialism, and to see where and why they had failed, and to develop more appropriate strategies.The fact that we were putting into question dominant concepts like mauritianism and nationalism is probably the reason why there is so much confusion about the theme of our conference. But it is no excuse for shoddy thinking and borderline bad faith on the part of an organisation that pompously calls itself : âDemocracy Watchâ.But what seemed to have horrified the DWM team is the proposition that LALIT has always maintained: communalism derives from the reflex that some people have to attribute their position as victims of social inequality to their so-called community, and traditional bourgeois politicians exploiting this reflex for political gains. In LALIT we believe that to counter this communalist ideology, we need to encourage class consciousness, where people interprete social inequality in class terms, and the struggle against social inequality and injustice is thus a âclass struggleâ. Nothing to do with the âmaniÃ¨re violenteâ that DWM attributes to the struggle against social inequality and injustice.DWMâs response to the âclass struggleâ politics of LALIT is entitled: âLa lutte des classes menace lâUnitÃ© Nationaleâ. Exactly, and that is why we believe that concepts like âmauritianismâ, and ânationalismâ form part of bourgeois ideology, and are not appropriate tools to counter communalism or imperialism, precisely because they aim to deny the fact that social inequality and injustice derives from the very nature of a class society. DWM expose their ideological view point when they write: âLe mauricianisme peut justement se dÃ©finir par notre volontÃ© de vivre ensemble comme des frÃ¨res et des soeurs dâune mÃªme famille humaine et mauricienne. Dans une famille digne de ce nom, et profondÃ©ment unie, il ne saurait y avoir de la place pour une guerre meurtriÃ¨re entre des frÃ¨res moins chanceux et des frÃ¨res plus chanceux. â If this is DWMâs definition of the society we are living in, that the boss is âmore luckyâ and the worker âless luckyâ, then maybe we are wasting our time replying to them. Yvan Martial (a member of Blok 104) and the other bourgeois ideologues of DWM  expose the superficiality of their analyses with statements such as: âToute lutte des classes ne peut quâÃªtre l'opposition voulue dâune partie, mÃªme majoritaire, dâune population contre une autre, possiblement minoritaire.  â âNous ne pouvons nier, non plus, que nombre de cas de pauvretÃ© et de misÃ¨re sont dus Ã  des carences personnelles, pour ne rien dire des flÃ©aux (drogue, alcool, jeux, prostitution, hÃ©donisme, Ã©goÃ¯sme, mentalitÃ© dâassistÃ©) qui encouragent ces incapacitÃ©s dâassumer des responsabilitÃ©s propres Ã  tout homme digne de ce nom. On ne peut pas indÃ©finiment demander aux plus laborieux d'entre nous de se sacrifier pour venir en aide Ã  ceux dâentre nous qui entendent vivre comme des parasites. â And we thought we were living as one big happy family, according to DWM!âLa lutte des classes est une idÃ©ologie importÃ©e. Elle a, plus d'une fois, Ã©talÃ© ses Ã©checs les plus cuisants. Des communistes dÃ©clarÃ©s promeuvent aujourdâhui le capitalisme le plus ultralibÃ©ral, le plus sauvage, au mÃ©pris des droits dâautres hommes et dâautres femmes qu'ils exploitent. â We presume that DWM is referring to countries like China. So when the working class is exploited by capitalism in China, this is âsauvageâ and does not respect the rights of workers, but here in Mauritius, the same ultra-liberal capitalism makes us into one big happy family. How is that for intellectual integrity!The views of DWM on what they call the communalist âflÃ©auâ is even more revealing: âDemocracy Watch ne peut nier quâil existe une part de communalisme dans lâesprit malade de certains de nos frÃ¨res et soeurs mauriciens. â They seem to think that this âflÃ©auâ or malady affects mainly the public sector: âCe flÃ©au ne doit affecter quâun petit pourcentage de nos employÃ©s du service publicâ. So what is it like outside of the public sector that employs a small proportion of the total workforce. In the private sector where, according to DWM, all the wealth is produced, this happens âgrÃ¢ce Ã  la mÃ©ritocratie prÃ©valent de maniÃ¨re exemplaire dans notre beau pays. â So for DWM, the communalism that comes from the sick minds of some Mauritians, is entirely to do with recruitment and promotion in the Civil Service and Parastatals, whereas there is perfect meritocracy in the private or capitalist sector. The ideas of the DWM team of thinkers (which includes elements of Blok 104) on a subject as important as the dangers of communalism show just how important it is that we continue to put into question the habitual clichÃ©s and slogans.
