WTO protests begin world wide!
11.09.2003
The 10th of September marked the beginning of the world wide protests against the WTO and capitalist globalisation. Parallel to the March held in Mauritius yesterday (see news) people are taking to the street all around the globe. In Karnataka, India, 35,000 peasants demonstrated yesterday. In Cancun, despite the repressive arsenal set up by the state, protest actions are underway.  In a desperate action to show the plight of farmers in this WTO-led capitalist world, a Korean farmer killed himself in Cancun. Please visit the following websites and those in our links to keep informed of the protests going on, as well of what is taking place in Cancun itself. http://www.indymedia.org/http://www.focusweb.org/http://www.twnafrica.org/
