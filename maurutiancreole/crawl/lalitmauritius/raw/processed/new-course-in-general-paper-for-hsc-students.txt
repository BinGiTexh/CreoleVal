New course in General Paper for HSC students
12.01.2011
LALIT has pleasure in publishing a letter we received from LPT concerning their new courses for General Paper, starting this Saturday, 15 January.Dear Friends,As 2011 begins, we are pleased to be able to send details of the new course for HSC students in General Paper. As you may know, the General Paper examination that Cambridge sets attempts to test the general level of competence in high level thinking, that is to say, in reasoning right through an argument, in analysing the logic in a statement, in interlinking points, in giving different perspectives to a subject, and in the precision of a studentâs linguistic expression. However, the school system has spent 11 years teaching students to rely uniquely on rote learning, i.e not thinking. This means the level of results at GP exams in Mauritius is very low. LPTâs course thus has two aims: The first one, from the studentsâ point of view, is perhaps to do well in the examination. But education is much more than doing well at a mere examination. It is ideally the awakening of childrenâs intellect, a training for them in how to think, a nurturing of their creative instinct, and a collective experience with their peers. So this is the second, and most important element of the LPT course. Then there is a link between the two: LPTâs course helps young people to put structure into the knowledge that they already have, thus multiplying their potential.Many young people who have just finished their SC, do not know about the LPT lessons for General Paper. We ask you please to let them know.
