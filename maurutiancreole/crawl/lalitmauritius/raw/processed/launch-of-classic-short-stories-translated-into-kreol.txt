Launch of classic short stories translated into Kreol
12.12.2019
On Human Rights Day 10 December,Â Ledikasyon pu TravayerÂ published a beautiful pocket-sized collection of short stories by great writers in Kreol. This is a landmark in the rich, ongoing literary production in Kreol. LALIT congratulates LPT and the translators for this contribution.Â Â The translated stories are byÂ Leo Tolstoy from Russia,Â Edgar Allen Poe andÂ O. HenryÂ from the USA, Saadat Hasan Manto,Â Ammani Ammal andÂ AbburiÂ ChayadeviÂ from the Indian Sub-Continent,Â NgÅ©gÄ© wa Thiongâo from Kenya, Oscar Wilde from Ireland, the Brothers Grimm from Germany andÂ ArthurÂ Conan Doyle from Scotland. The mini-compendium is designed specially for young people, now at college, who have studied Mauritian Kreol as a subject.Â In his launch speech, writer Carl de Souza spoke on the progress of the Kreol language over recent years and on the importance of the standardization of the orthography of the language, and on the importance of reading the kind of literature in this collection. He spoke in the enchanting setting of a crowded âBook Loverâ, the Grand River North West bookshop.Â Â It will be an ideal New Yearâs present, Rada Kistnasamy, presiding, said. Eight of the eleven translators were present,Â Hassenjee Essackjee, Lindsay Dhookit, Vijay Naraidoo, Alain Ah-Vee,Â Jayen Teeroovengadum,Â Kavinien Karupudayyan, Lindsey Collen andÂ Abdool Hafez Abdoolah. Readings were done from three of the stories by Flavia Doherty-Bigara, Anne-Sophie Pyanee and Kavinien Karupudayyan.Â Â Alain Ah-Vee, speaking for LPT with the aplomb only he has on this subject, linked the freedom to speak and read-and-write in your own language with human rights day and how the Government was announcing that Kreol will be introduced into Parliament. But that Government is always using various pretexts for delay. Alain linked freedom in general with the absence of the old colonial, linguistic restraints to creativity, and how in LPT and other organizations, we along with writers and artists, have just seized our freedom, freed ourselves, by writing in Kreol just like that. Over the decades, this has made us confident and has produced the beginnings of a whole writtenÂ oeuvreÂ in Kreol.Â Â The book is available at LPT Bookshop and at Le Cygne in Rose-Hill at Rs 100/=. Here is the entire contents page:Â Enn Leker ki KozeÂ par Edgar Allen Poe (AÂ Tell-Tale HeartÂ tradir Ananda Devi)Â Misie Egoist LaÂ par Oscar Wilde (The Selfish GiantÂ adapte Jean Lindsay Dhookit)LaviÂ BonzaiÂ parÂ AbburiÂ Chayadevi (BonsaiÂ BratukuÂ tradir Rajwantee Dalliah)Tipti Tifi Pli Malin ki Gran-Gran ZomÂ par Leo Tolstoy (Children are Wiser than EldersÂ tradir Hassenjee Essackjee)Seki nou Atann, Seki AriveÂ par Ammani Ammal (Sankalpamoum SambavamoumÂ tradir Kavinien Karupudayyan)Kado Trwa MazÂ par O.
