24.02.2014
We are pleased to be able to guide our web-site visitors interested in the economy, and in particular in the need for an alternative economy for Mauritius, to our Audio Section. There, newly up-loaded, are about 10 different short recordings taken from Ram Seegobinâs interview on Top FM on Wednesday 19 February, 2014. Taken together, these short audio-files are a tour-de-force, giving full arguments for the need for a new kind of politics of the economy. They also, in passing, pay homage to LALITâs long campaign since 1983 to think of the economy and not of cane, when thinking of land use. The interviewer was Jimmy Jean-Louis. Together on the program there was also Raffick Chattaroo, a planter and previous president of the bossâs Sugar Syndicate. Everything in the these audio files is naturally is Kreol.To listen to the audio clips, o to the download section in the top right column of our website, and double click on the audio section.
