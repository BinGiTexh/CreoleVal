A Memory of Memories of a Press Photographer: JÃ©rÃ´me de Souza
14.12.2017
When the press photographer JÃ©rÃ´me de Souza died in 2005 at 27 years old, it was a painful loss to all who knew him. His father, the writer Carlo de Souza took 10 years before he finally decided that he was perhaps emotionally ready to take on going through the collection of photographs that JÃ©rÃ´me had left behind him. And during this process, he decided, as a tribute to his son and as a way to expiate the painful mourning he and his family and friends inevitably go through after such a deathÂ  (1), to publish a book of his photographs. And that was how he appealed to about 10 writers and photographers to include contributions. I was one of those appealed to for a few words (I have appended them below).Â And this is how 12 years after his death, JÃ©rÃ´me de Souza has given us a book Brulantes Visions (Red Hot Glimpses) that captures fleeting images of life in Mauritius. The book launch was held at LâArtelier in St. Louis Street in Port Louis on Friday 10 December, in a convivial atmosphere, with photographs adorning the walls.Â The photographs taken as a whole portray a sensitive anti-macho photographer. As much as they portray what is in front of his lens. Jerome has a gentle view of an often cruel world, a view that, at the same time, stands up firmly (until now, when he has been gone 12 years) for the oppressed, for the struggling, for the ordinary pleasures of ordinary people and for the poor. Yet gently. The very opposite of the macho male reality he was so often obliged to photograph.Â Perhaps the most telling photograph of the whole collection is the one of the young woman in home-clothes who has come out on to the streets, standing hands on hips facing down a horde of armed Riot Police. She stands there, a woman, with nonchalent disdain, right in the middle of the police stand-off in the uprising that followed the death of another gentle soul, the singer, Kaya, killed while in police custody in 1999 and, in his death, provoking days of rebellion against the Authorities. The photograph was snapped at around the time that Berger Agathe would, in turn, be killed right near there by police. And then two young people, Gino Laurent (22 years) and Leemul Goosteea (18 years), would be killed by police officers during the same uprising in the village Ram Seegobin and I live in, Bambous, the next day. The photograph is one split-second of time that evokes, for me, all that.Â Another photograph, away this time from all the action, is of two women in the Richelieu temporary longÃ¨res, sitting around, lazy of an afternoon â one of them picking nits from the head of a child resting in her lap. The peacefulness of the women, their calm, in the face of extreme hardship is captured in the photograph. By chance, I know them well, from Muvman Lakaz. They were evicted from their previous lodgings. So, although the photograph is away from all the action, it has a memory of violent eviction, from before the photograph. And when these and 90 other families will enter and occupy a new housing estate during a cyclone warning, they will again have to face up to eviction. But this time around, they will unite and win! All that in one photograph of two relaxed women and a child.Â And when Jerome accompanied a journalist interviewing me, he wanted me â I had hundreds of afro-plaits at the time â in front of a rough wall painting of Che Guevara on airbrick, at the LALIT officesâ back verandah. And the plaits in my hair were crafted so beautifully by my friend, the widow of Kaya, Veronique Topize â she who became so active in opposing police violence. Again, a photograph in repose, but with a chain of lives of action in it.Â And he is the only photographer who captured the moment when Ram Seegobin, Serge Rayapoulle and I had been confronting police sent to spy on LALIT when we had called a preparatory meeting to plan a demonstration for when President of the USA, George W. Bush was due to come to Mauritius on a State visit (he didnât in the end, because he started bombing Bhagdad instead). This incident â where Ram is captured in the photograph denouncing the fact that the police had sent an informer to pretend to hold a public meeting (with no public at all) at the Social Centre just so as to âjustifyâ the police presence, that would otherwise have been illegal â would perhaps have been forgotten, but for the Police later charging Ram and me, in two separate cases, with âharassment of police officersâ, when they were sent to harass us. For the record, Father Henri Souchon came to the Court as witness. And for the record, we were both found not guilty. Political cases are always hard to prove under criminal law â the law does not fit the offense, which in turn does not really âexistâ. And JÃ©rÃ´me captures this ephemereal moment. In the case of my aquittal, the police had added an additional handicap to their case: they had misread their own handwriting, and when I had said, âmoustache la?â (meaning âare you referring to the police officer with a moustache?â), they had later read their notes, when given political orders to find something to prosecute us for, misread this as me calling a police officer âmoutouc laâ (meaning, of all things, âthe maggotâ)! And JÃ©rÃ´meâs photograph captures the moment that now, as I write this review, brings to life all the absurdity of that moment.Â The collection includes a haunting photograph of Charlesia Alexis, in which there is a stare of accusation for what was done to Chagossians, right next to a ravann, representing the cultural heritage saved. Another unforgettable photograph, full of cultural references, is the man reclining on a rattanware sofa, with the textured corrugated iron walls, the stone floors, and the six sticks of beautiful old furniture, as he reads the Chinese newspaper.Â There is a curious aspect to the book Brulantes Visions: a handful of photographs are included, not as photographs (maybe the negatives were not available? maybe it was a conscious choice?), but as a part of newspaper cuttings. And these are of the hard macho world. The contrast in texture is quite shocking to the reader. A cruel reminder of how difficult it is for a gentle soul to work in the world of journalism.Â And while talking about the cruel world, there is one photograph that remains with one long after one has put the book down. It is of a woman. She is sitting right on the ground against nondescript palings of some sort, in short shorts, in what for women is considered an inelegant pose, almost baring her crotch, clearly unaware of being photographed. As if society treats her as disposable. She is left, as it were, to her own devices. In whatever pain she may be. That, too, JÃ©rÃ´me could capture.Â I commend the book of photographs to everyone interested in Mauritian society, in Mauritian history, in photography, and in just plain life.

Stop talking! Silence! the teacher screams. Now, gagged, all.All? No. One little boy, seeming to be doing his sums, is interpreting his dreams, writing a song on his dhal puri wrapper, passing it to a friend at the back of the class, knowing one day who knows maybe weâll all be free.Â Â Â So you see, it is taking the powers-that-be that have existed for a mere few thousand years, quite some time.

No, that is not âune fauteille en paillesâ, the teacher shrieks, pointing at a page. Isnât it? Now, blinkered all.All? No. One little boy, when no-one is watching, sees. He sees a moment when the shadow of a leaf dances across the classroom wall, and he seizes it, captures it as it crosses the inside cover of his text book.So you see, it is taking the powers-that-be that have existed for a mere few thousand years, quite some time.
