To the comrades of LALITFrom Socialist Resistance UKRe: conference on October 30th.Unfortunately we have not been able to send a representative to your conference which starts on October 30th. We would never-the-less like to declare our full and active support for the cause for which you are fighting: the closure of the Diego Garcia military base, the end of the illegal occupation of the Chagos Islands and the right of return for the Chagossian people. We are aware of the role of successive British Governments in these injustices and want to be a part of your ongoing campaign against them. Please keep us informed of all aspects of your campaigning, particularly regarding activity in Britain. We will do all we can to support your activity and initiatives.In solidarityAlan Thornett (For Socialist resistance)
