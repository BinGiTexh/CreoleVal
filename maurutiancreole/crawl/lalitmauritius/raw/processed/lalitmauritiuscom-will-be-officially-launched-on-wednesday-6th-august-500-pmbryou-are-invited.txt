Our website, lalitmauritius.com, will be officially launched on Wednesday 6 August by a press conference and a get-together. The Press Conference will be held in the morning for the press. All Lalit supporters are invited and are warmly welcomed for the special get-together which will be held at the: Mother Earth Hall,  Grand River North West, Port Louis, at 5.00 p.m. Lalit would like to thank all the visitors who have made valuable comments on our website during the trial period. In fact lalitmauritius.com, which was only on test, had more than 2,000 hits since 6 June 2003.  International visitors are now invited to mail their comments to lalit@lalitmauritius.com. These comments will be included in the launching get-together to be held next Wednesday. By the way the webmasterâs team of TelecomPlus has up to now refused to link our site to the official portal of Mauritius Telecom. All political parties of Mauritius, (many of them whose site are not even working!!) are linked but not Lalitâs ones.  One wonder whyâ¦.Lalit will deal with TelecomPlus with the appropriate mean after the official launching. In the meantime let us celebrate this new and alternative means of communication â¦..â¦. now at the service of alternative views and politics.
