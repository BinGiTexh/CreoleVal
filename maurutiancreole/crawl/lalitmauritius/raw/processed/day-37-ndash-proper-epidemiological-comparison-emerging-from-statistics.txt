Day 37 – Proper Epidemiological Comparison Emerging from Statistics
26.04.2020
The good news at a national level is epidemiological news. Dr Zouberr Joomye, who is for some reason (maybe that he is a transfiz and then not elected in the last elections), the Government spokesperson at the Coronavirus press briefings announced the key figures we in LALIT were waiting for i.e. the number of deaths, month by month, for 2019 and 2020. This was in reply to a question from the Press. The figures suggest no sign of out-of-control, invisible spread of Covid in the population. This is important news in itself, and also because of Navin Ramgoolam’s irresponsible statements. And also because some of the media, as well as droves on the internet, have persisted in spreading a kind of low-key fear that there is a huge “iceberg” of cases of Covid-19 under the tip of published Government statistics and that there are even alleged hidden deaths. These insinuations spread like wild-fire amongst people who do not use the free, universal hospital services and their ignorance of this excellent service probably makes them more liable to believe far-fetched things. To make these insinuations and rumours more pernicious, there are, in fact, real dangers of not knowing how many cases there are because of the high number of people without Covid-19 symptoms who nevertheless spread the disease. The inability to test whole cross-sections of people – this is true in almost all countries except South Korea and Germany – has added to the power of the insinuations. And, then again, this is not a Government that inspires generalized confidence. We, in LALIT, for example, charge the Government with bowing down, like minions, to the sugar cane bosses and other big land owners. But, now the figures are out. Study these figures for a minute:2019Jan     Feb     Mar     Apr     983    826     930      8452020Jan     Feb     Mar     Apr (to 16th)915     826     906     446 More specifically, the Government has given figures for deaths from respiratory illness: 2019Jan     Feb     Mar     Apr     137    112     145      1042020Jan     Feb     Mar     Apr (to 16th) 96     110     129       56 The slightly lesser figures for 2020 are not necessarily strange: The lockdown will have decreased the spread of flu and cold viruses, as well – that can have a toll on people with underlying health problems – and there will have been fewer road accidents and work injuries. Take the above table together with three sets of figures for coronavirus figures day-by-day to date for total positive cases (note the curve flattened completely, so far), the new cases by day (a bit sporadic but tending downwards, and we can expect new outbreaks here and there for a long time), and the total active cases (in Mauritius this differs from other countries because the State admits all positive cases into hospital or quasi hospital institutions), which has decreased to manageable proportions. To see the tables, go to the version in our Documents Section, or on our Facebook page. Or you can read the raw data pasted at the end of this article, in vertical form.  And, after studying the data, this is what we can, for the moment, conclude: 1. The lockdown (including the one week of total curfew) was just in time, and has thus worked to flatten and bend down the various curves, signifying a degree of actual containment of the spread of the virus. This is a credit to people of Mauritius understanding the importance of this, despite the Government not explaining very clearly, and despite the Government being one that is tolerated but not particularly popular (remember although they won 2/3 of seats in the National Assembly in the November elections, they did not muster the well-nigh compulsory celebratory public meeting!)2. The people of Mauritius have managed the social distancing rules, have worn masks when they have gone out, have washed their hands a lot and avoided touching their faces. The universal hand-shaking every day has totally disappeared. As has cheek-kissing. Many people wear gloves in public. Coughs and sneezes are aimed, even when people are wearing masks, I notice, into the bend of their elbows. It has become normal to have sanitizer pumped into your hands or gloves twice before you get into a supermarket and to have your temperature taken at the lintel of the supermarket – of all places. 3. The quarantine of people, in particular, the Government putting them up in empty hotels, if they have been in any way exposed to the virus (coming from abroad, working in hospitals) was important, too, in severely containing the spread.4. The unusual measure of the hospitalization of all Covid 19 positive people, even those who are asymptomatic, has tightened up containment even more.5. Perhaps key to the relative success (so far) has been the fantastic “trace-and-test” teams in Mauritius – who have then permitted the complete isolation in hospitals of all who test positive, i.e. even people who are without any symptoms.6. Rodrigues and Agalega have been completely spared the virus by the timely lockdown. There is other good news on the national front. In response to an outcry from unions, us in LALIT, consumer groups and others, at the exploitative pricing of essential goods, there is now a much-expanded list of price-controlled goods. Here is a link where you can access it:https://www.lalitmauritius.org/modules/documents/files/LalitMauritius-f9b902fc3289af4dd08de5d1de54f68f.pdf On the Ragoo Lane front, we have a beautiful air potato (pom-deler) on the front fencing, ready for harvest. It is truly the most remarkable staple food crop of all. It is completely autogestionary. Like so many vegetables, it seems to come from South America. The only problem with it is that it can be invasive, so plant it in a barrel to begin with, until you know its ways. Lindsey Collenfor LALIT, a personal view.   Date       Positive Cases18-Mar             319-Mar             720-Mar           1221-Mar           1422-Mar           2823-Mar           3624-Mar           4225-Mar           4826-Mar           8127-Mar           9428-Mar         10229-Mar         10730-Mar         12831-Mar         14301-Apr         16102-Apr         16903-Apr         18604-Apr         19605-Apr         22706-Apr         24407-Apr         26808-Apr         27309-Apr         31410-Apr         31811-Apr         31912-Apr         32813-Apr         32414-Apr         32415-Apr         32416-Apr         32417-Apr         32418-Apr         32519-Apr         32820-Apr         32821-Apr         32822-Apr         32923-Apr         33124-Apr         33125-Apr         331 Date    New Cases18-Mar     319-Mar                 420-Mar     5 21-Mar     222-Mar   1423-Mar     824-Mar     625-Mar     626-Mar    3327-Mar                1328-Mar                  829-Mar                  530-Mar                2131-Mar                  501-Apr     1802-Apr       803-Apr     1704-Apr     1005-Apr     3106-Apr     1707-Apr     2408-Apr       509-Apr     4110-Apr       411-Apr       112-Apr       513-Apr       014-Apr       015-Apr       016-Apr       017-Apr       018-Apr       119-Apr       320-Apr       021-Apr       022-Apr       123-Apr       224-Apr       025-Apr       0 Date    Active Cases18-Mar                  319-Mar                  720-Mar                  1221-Mar                  1322-Mar                  2623-Mar                  3424-Mar                  4025-Mar                  4626-Mar                  7927-Mar                  9228-Mar                  10029-Mar                  10530-Mar                  12531-Mar                  13801-Apr       15502-Apr       16203-Apr       17904-Apr       18905-Apr       22006-Apr       23307-Apr       25308-Apr       24709-Apr       28410-Apr       28611-Apr       28212-Apr       27713-Apr       26414-Apr       26115-Apr       24716-Apr       23117-Apr       20418-Apr       13319-Apr       10820-Apr         9221-Apr         7322-Apr         5623-Apr         5324-Apr         3425-Apr         24
