LALIT Reminds you â Register as elector now!
01.08.2021
As you know, everyone has to check every year, when the Electorsâ Roll is renewed, that their name is on the list.Â So, we are gently reminding you to do so in the next few days. The deadline was due to be 31 July, but the it has been extended for one week until 6 AUGUST; the extension is so as to accommodate anyone who might have been in a Covid âRed Zoneâ, or otherwise disturbed by the Covid epidemic, the Electoral Commissioner announced.Voting is an important part of the little democracy that has been fought for and won through past struggles. Protect it! Fight for more democracy at the same time!ARE YOU ALREADY ON THE ELECTORAL REGISTER?If you have already been on the Register and have not changed address, you have four choices, on how to check and confirm that all is well in 2021:EITHER,Â you just send an SMS to number 789 as follows:elec [Your Identity Card Number]i.e.Â Â elec [and a space] then your National Identity Card Number.We have been doing this exercise on-the-spot in our LALIT branch meetings, and have found that we get a reply either immediately or within a minute or so. It works.This costs you 50 cents.[However a test done in the middle of the day on Sunday 1st of August this did not work on MT, but it did work on Emtel]OR,you can check free if you go on to the site of the Electoral Commissionerâs OfficeÂ https://electoral.govmu.orgÂ and click on the box that says:Â âAre you Registered as an Elector?â And check this way.OR, you go to the nearest centre â a couple in all 21 constituencies plus Agalega â being used for Registration (list below, see exact time in official communiquÃ© below â Lil Moris 4:00 a 5:30 pm; Lil Rodrig 3:30 a 5:00 pm)Or you can go in person to the Electoral Commissionerâs office in Port Louis (see address and opening hours below in official notice)IS THIS THE FIRST TIME YOU WILL BE VOTING?Anyone who has just turned 18 years old, or has not yet registered for any other reason, or has changed name or address needs to Register as an elector NOW.

In times when there is a push from the extreme right-wing against democracy, we need to be aware of dangers of things getting less democratic. At the same time, we must continue the struggle to extend our democratic rights further in the future. In particular, we need the National Assembly to be strengthened relative to the executive and the electors to get more power relative to those elected.
