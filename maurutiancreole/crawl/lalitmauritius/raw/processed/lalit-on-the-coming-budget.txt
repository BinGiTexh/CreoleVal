LALIT on the coming budget
05.10.2013
This morning in the Top FM radio program Leve do mo pep, LALIT member Ram Seegobin spoke on the coming budget and the need to address the economic crisis. The program is a phone-in program interacting with an invtied âanimateurâ. Many points raised by phone-in participants were very interesting developing the point that it is not a political priority for the present Ramgoolam government to develop the agro-industrial and food transformation sector and the fishing sector. Both sectors, as Ram Seegobin argued could provide employment by the thousands and constitute a basis for economic development.You can hear an audio clip of Ram Seegobin in this program by clicking on audio.
