10.01.2004
In a press conference held on Thursday 8th of January, Lalit and the Chagos Refugees Group announced that a joint delegation of both organisations will be participating in the World Social Forum to be held in Mumbai, India, from the 16th to 21st January 2004. The main objective of this joint delegation is to campaign for the return of  the Chagossian people to Chagos Archipelagos and for the closure of the US military Base at Diego Garcia and in favour of an Indian Ocean Peace Zone. (see the previous News entitled "U.S. Military Base On Diego Garcia:  The Intersection Of  So Many Struggles"The World Social Forum is an open space initiated by the social and people's movement to oppose capitalist globalisation and its military might and to foster political alternative. The slogan of the WSF is "Another World Is Possible".  It is the first time that a Mauritian delegation will be attending the WSF. The previous three editions were held in Porto Allegre, Brazil. Olivier Bancoult, spokesperson of the CRG in the press conference, explained that the aim of the CRG is to put "our  feet on the Chagos Archipelagos during the course of this year". "Those States like the UK and US who are giving human rights lessons to the world, should look back at their face. The Chagossian people has been the victims of one the most blatant human rights violation of the last century" he added. Three people, Olivier Bancoult himself, Ms. Talate Jaffar and the CRG legal adviser will form part of the CRG delegation in Mumbai. O. Bancoult stressed that the GRC is in favour of Indian Peace Zone and thus opposes US Base at Diego Garcia. He said the WSF provides an excellent opportunity to build support from various anti-war, peace, human rights, and social justice movement to support the campaign for Chagossian people to go on Diego Garcia during the course of this year. Olivier Bancoult also outlined the historical participation of Lalit's militants in the Chagossian struggle since the early 70's. Lindsey Collen, Lalit spokesperson in the press conference, said that the WSF is of great historical significance in the quest of an  alternative to the global capitalist barbarism and militarism. Distinguished people,  including two Nobel Prize Award, as well Novelist like Arundhati Roy will participate in the WSF. In addition top speakers also include prominent alter-globalisation activists who also lectured in Mauritius upon Lalit's initiative. Jose Bove, Dr. Vandana Shiva, Dot Kheet, Trevor N'gwane and Yash Tandon, who all visited  Mauritius during the recent years, will participate in Conferences who will be attended by some 8,000 to 20,000 people in Mumbai. Lindsey Collen said that one of the main focus of Lalit participation will be Diego Garcia. Together with the CRG, Lalit will be participating in three main activities:- Meeting on the Japanese world renowned Peace Boat who will be in Mumbai for the WSF- The General Assembly of the anti-war movement - The meeting of the No US Base Network, where Lalit is amongst the co-foundersThe aim of these activities, Lindsey Collen said, is  to seek active support for the Campaign called "Bring Back the Chagossian Ã¯Â¿Â½ Close the US Base on Diego Garcia". Contact will also be established with anti-war groups and peace militants to gather logistical support to "put our feet on Chagos during the course of this year" she added.  Lindsey Collen said that the struggle on the Chagos issue is three folds interlinked. And it is when these linkages come together that there are victories. The first level of the struggle is the struggle for the right of the Chagossian people to return to Chagos which also includes their right for compensation and reparation. The second level the struggle is the campaign for the dismantlement of the US military base on Diego Garcia and for an Indian Ocean Peace Zone, which include its total de-nuclearisation. And the third level is the struggle for the re-unification of the Mauritian territory to include the Chagos Archipelagos, illegally detached during our Independence process in the 60's. Thus completing our de-colonization process. "These three interlink issues and struggles cannot be separated" Lindsey Collen of Lalit concluded. 5 Lalit militants,  Ram Seegobin, Lindsey Collen, Alain Ahvee and Sharon Jaquin will be in  Mumbai for the WSF. Ian Jacob from the Lalit Youth will be participating  in the International Youth Camp of the WSF. Lalit's militants,  apart from the focus on Diego Garcia activities, will also be participating in the African Social Forum meeting which will be held in Mumbai and other "alter-globalisation" activities, specially on WTO and trade issues and the relation between social and political movement. Some Lalit militants will also attend meetings of the Green Movement and Left Parties who will be in Mumbai. For more information on the WSF please go on www.wsfindia.org
