VOTE FIRST FOR THE LALIT CANDIDATE-List of LALIT candidates
29.10.2019
There are only three ways of recognizing a LALIT candidate (or candidate of any other party for that matter) on the ballot paper: - by the name of the party, LALIT, next to the candidates name,- by the symbol of the party, - or by number, couting from a candidate whose surname starts with A down to a last one nearer Z. Our election mo-dord is: VOTE FIRST FOR THE LALIT CANDIDATE. But, remember that everyone has to vote for 3 candidates for their vote to count. Apart from in Constituency No. 1 where our headquarters are, we have either one or two candidates. We call on people to decide locally on those Independent candidates, or other non-communal and non-3-main-block candidates, to vote for, to make up the three.  Most people vote by party symbol. They do this either because they are not able to read or read confidently enough, or because of the length of the ballot when there are so many candidates.   In fact, the only time when everyone in the intellectual elite recognises the fact that a large proportion of the population cannot read-and-write is at election time, when a lot of emphasis is put on the party or alliance symbol. The rest of the time, the intelligentsia lives in denial of the high rate of people not being literate.Anyway, LALIT’s symbol is billhook and hammer crossed over, meaning working class unity – industrial and agricultural workers – with the two tools amended so as to be also a bird and a giraffe, meaning respect for our place in nature. Our name LALIT in Kreol means struggle and in Hindi means beautiful. And here are the numbers of our 24 candidates.  CONSTITUENCY NO. 1 - GRAND RIVER NORTH WEST AND PORT LOUIS WEST 2        ADELIA, Marie Christinne Isabelle  12      BOUSAC, Roland Clovis 16      DUVAL, Surekha  CONSTITUENCY NO. 2 - PORT LOUIS SOUTH AND PORT LOUIS CENTRAL 23      LARHUBARBE, Denis Michael   CONSTITUENCY NO. 3 - PORT LOUIS MARITIME AND PORT LOUIS EAST10      COLLEN SEEGOBIN, Lindsey Claire  CONSTITUENCY NO. 4 - PORT LOUIS NORTH AND MONTAGNE LONGUE31      NARAINA, Mary Joice Sarahjane  CONSTITUENCY NO. 5 - PAMPLEMOUSSES AND TRIOLET44      KISTNASAMY, Batmadevi  CONSTITUENCY NO. 6 - GRAND BAIE AND POUDRE D'OR20      LE MERLE, Marie Daniele  CONSTITUENCY NO. 7 - PITON AND RIVIÈRE DU REMPART19       HERCHENRODER, Georges Clément  CONSTITUENCY NO. 8 - QUARTIER MILITAIRE AND MOKA19      RAMEN, Satyavani , also known as Sudha  CONSTITUENCY NO. 9 - FLACQ AND BON ACCUEIL20      KISTNASAMY, Seeven Vinaya , also known as Rada  CONSTITUENCY NO. 10 - MONTAGNE BLANCHE AND GRAND RIVER SOUTH EAST3       BATOUR, Pierre Christian 49      MURDAY, Seetresen  CONSTITUENCY NO. 11 - VIEUX GRAND PORT AND ROSE BELLE24      ONNO, Elvis Franco  CONSTITUENCY NO. 12 - MAHEBOURG AND PLAINE MAGNIEN17      FOZOO, Louis Roland  CONSTITUENCY NO. 13 - RIVIERE DES ANGUILLES AND SOUILLAC12      CLELIE, Marie Anouchka Cindy  CONSTITUENCY NO. 14 - SAVANNE AND BLACK RIVER39      YVES, Ange Laval  CONSTITUENCY NO. 15 - LA CAVERNE AND PHOENIX24      SABINE, Marie Judith Guilliana  CONSTITUENCY NO. 16 - VACOAS AND FLOREAL2        BAUDA, Louis Max 15      LALLAH, Rajni  CONSTITUENCY NO. 17 - CUREPIPE AND MIDLANDS23      MAVISA, Marie Martine  CONSTITUENCY NO. 18 - BELLE ROSE AND QUATRE BORNES1      AH VEE, George Alain  CONSTITUENCY NO. 19 - STANLEY AND ROSE HILL21      HOSENBOKUS, Oumar Ally  CONSTITUENCY NO. 20 - BEAU BASSIN AND PETITE RIVIERE10      HOMET, Gary
