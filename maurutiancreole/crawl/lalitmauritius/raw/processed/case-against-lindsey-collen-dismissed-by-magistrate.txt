Case Against Lindsey Collen "dismissed" by Magistrate
09.05.2005
Today in the District Court of Port Louis, Magistrate Pentiah dismissed the charge that the Police had laid against Lalit member, Lindsey Collen, to the effect that she had "molested a Police Officer". The false charge was laid against two Lalit members, Lindsey Collen and Ram Seegobin around an incident when the Common Front against George G. Bush was planning a street demonstration for the visit US President was due to make to Mauritius for the AGOA Forum in January, 2003. For details of the case see article on postponement last Friday. The almost identical charge against Ram Seegobin was also dismissed, in a separate judgement towards the end of last year.
