Message from Action Committee against US-Japan Security Pact
09.11.2010
We are a peace group that was founded to fight against the US-Japan Security Pact. The treaty has allowed the continuous stationing of US forces in Japan despite the end of the US occupation after the World War II. The situation in Okinawa, an archipelago that used to form a kingdom with unique culture, is notorious. The US military has kept on reigning over the populace after many of them were killed in the Battle of Okinawa. Many people were excluded violently from the land they had inherited, and have been suffered from noise and US soldiers' crime. Besides, they are forced to be part of aggressions by the US forces. Let's struggle together to achieve a world free from US bases and to reclaim our land for life and production.Action Committee against US-Japan Security Pact
