Lalit web site was down
13.04.2005
Dear web site visitor,We would like to apologise for our site having been down. Especially at this crucial moment, where all over the world people are checking out our site, in the process of preparing to sign the Diego Garcia petition.What happened is this: We changed server (because of a lower price) and the new server after a week said that our site was âtoo controversialâ. We suppose the Diego Garcia petition is indeed controversial.So, we quickly returned to our original host.In Lalit, we are, of course, trying to work out what this experience means in the long run for freedom of expression on the web.
