On Thursday 22 June, Mauritius will at 10:00 am in New York submit its resolution before the UN General Assembly calling for the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on the issue of the excision of Chagos from Mauritius around Independence.

The resolution comes up before the General Assembly as Item 87 on Thursday. LALIT has contacted people all over the world for support from their respective Governments for this resolution. Already the Mauritian State has the support of the entire African union for the resolution. LALIT has also contacted two activists we know to contact Permanent Representatives at the UN whom they know, to inform them of the coming resolution.LALIT is part of the “Komite Diego” which will be holding a musical evening on Wednesday 21 June, it also being Music Day. As it is also the birthday of the late Bam Cuttayen, musician who sang the first well-known song on Diego Garcia, we are also celebrating his music, and some of the other songs on Diego Garcia.
