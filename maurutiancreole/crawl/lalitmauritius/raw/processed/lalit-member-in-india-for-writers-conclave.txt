Lalit member in India for Writers' Conclave
02.03.2006
Lalit member, Lindsey Collen, was amongst some 40 writers from Asia and Africa invited by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, a department in the Indian Foreign Affairs Ministry, to participate in a three day literary conference. The conference was conceptualized to mark the 50 years since the Bandung Conference on decolonization and was on the general theme:  'Continents of Creation: Legacy, Identity and Assertion'. Lindsey gave a talk on the Panel on 'Home, Homelessness and the Modern Predicament.' Each panel, she explained, had five or six writers speaking on a theme, and then there was interaction. There were also poetry readings in the evenings. The conclave was held against the enchanting background of the Neemrana Fort Palace constructed in 1464.
