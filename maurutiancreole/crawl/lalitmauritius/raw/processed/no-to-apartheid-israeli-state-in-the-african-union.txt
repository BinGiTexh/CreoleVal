We are calling on the government of Mauritius to oppose Israel being granted âobserver statusâ in the African union. This decision which was announced on July 22 by the Chairperson of the African union (AU) Commission, H.E. Moussa Faki Mahamat, was taken by the African union Commission without any prior consultation with other member states.
The Governments of South Africa, Nigeria, Namibia, Algeria and Tunisia have already publicly stated their opposition to this unilateral decision. Mauritius also should reject this undemocratic decision to accept Israelâs claim to accreditation so that the matter can be placed on the agenda of the next session of the AU executive Council.Â Â 
The AU has always taken position in support of the Palestinian cause through various declarations adopted at ordinary sessions of its Assembly. Any accreditation of Israel as an observer state would do injustice to the long-standing, principled position of solidarity with the Palestinian people expressed by the African union, its predecessor the Organization of African Unity (OAU), individual African states and the African people.
This decision of the AU Commission is most unwelcomed at a time when the Apartheid regime of Israel is increasing its acts of military aggression and oppression of the Palestinian people in total violation of international law.
Israel is maintaining more than 70 years of one of the most brutal and destructive examples of colonial rule and military occupation of Palestinian territory. Successive Israeli regimesâ measures have systematically divided the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory along racial lines, establishing separate reserves for Palestinians and expropriating their land. These acts amount to committing the crime of Apartheid.Â  Israel has acted with impunity over its decades of violations of human rights and international law.Â 
More recently the Israeli state has acted against initiatives to complete the decolonisation process in Africa. In 2017 at the United Nation General Assembly (UNGA) Israel voted against a resolution proposed by the African union calling for the ICJ to give an advisory opinion on British excision of Chagos from Mauritius.
