Supreme Court Judgments in India against biometric ID card
15.07.2014
As if the threat of a Rs100,000 fine and 5-year imprisonment were not enough, the Mauritius National Identity Card (MNIC) unit is now resorting to TV clips threatening the 200,000 people that haven't taken out their new biometric id cards yet that they will not be able to buy a house, get a SIM card or obtain credit to buy a fridge if they do not have the new card after the 15th of September this year. Such threats and practices have already been pronounced illegal by the Indian Supreme Court. The Supreme Court judgements could weigh heavily in the Constitution cases being heard in Mauritius given that Indian Supreme Court judgements are often quoted in Mauritian Courts and carry weight given the shared colonial history and law system and traditions in Mauritius and India. Mandatory ID card illegal for basic services There has been huge opposition to the biometric ID card in India that includes fingerprinting, an iris scan and a biometric facial photo. The ID card, called Aadhar card in India was at first introduced as a voluntary ID card to âfacilitateâ State payments and to diminish corruption in the public sector. It was then made mandatory for public services such as pensions, subsidies on cooking gas, agricultural subsidies for planters, for public sector workersâ wages and for marriage and other civil status registration. So in January 2014, enrolment for this âvoluntaryâ Aadhar card had reached 576.16 million making the Aadhar card database one of the biggest in the world.  In September last year, the Supreme Court made an order to stop public officers refusing public services to people without Aadhar cards. The Supreme Court had to re-issue an Order in March this year as there were so many cases of officers continuing to demand Aadhar cards in exchange for basic cervices. Judge Chauhan who headed the bench declared "I received a lot of letters which say Aadhaar card is mandatory despite court orders. One person in a letter said his marriage is not registered because of the lack of Aadhaar card, (others) say they can't get their properties registered. We had already passed orders saying no one should suffer for not having Aadhaar card," (see article on http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2588303/Supreme-Court-demolishes-Aadhaar-card-Judges-rule-card-NOT-mandatory-government-subsidies.html#ixzz37Wgw3gwq)It is interesting to note that one of the Supreme Court public interest litigations (PIL) was filed by aretired Karnataka High Court judge, Justice KS Puttaswamy, and a retired army general Maj. Gen. (retd) SG Vombatkere. Goa CIB police seeks access to entire Goa fingerprint databaseThe Indian experience of ID cards also exposes another terrible danger of biometric id cards that LALIT has warned about: in Goa after a 7-year child was raped in a school, the CIB police (similar to the Mauritian CID) requested access to the entire Aadhar card database of Goa to cross-match fingerprints it had found on the crime scene. A school is an open place used by children, teachers, parents, school staff and visitors. Anyone on the premises could have become a suspect. In the case, even the biometric technology expert defenders of the Aadhar card database admit that there was a 0.057% occurrence of false identification.  The case found its way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court Order of March this year decreed that a person's data given to one department cannot be shared with another department except with the written consent of that person.The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) started out, like the MNIC unit, with arguments that: "The contention that the scheme impinges on the numerous fundamental rights including the right to privacy is denied. The UIDAI seeks only very basic data on demographics like name, age or date of birth, gender and postal address. In case of biometric data, the fingerprint scans and iris are essential to undertake the de-duplication â¦.". When the UIDAI got confronted with requests from CIB police to give them access to the fingerprints of all adult citizens in a State, it was then that the UIDAI started realising the dangers of centralising personal information and biometric data of citizens. They refused to give CIB and Forensic access to fingerprints and took the issue to Court. The UIDAI fell into the trap of believing government propaganda that privacy of Aadhar card holders would be protected by the State. It seems the MNIC unit is falling into the same trap.LALIT is has pleasure in publishing a copy of the two Court Orders:First Supreme Court Order of September 2013:ITEM NO.5+56               Court No.5             SECTION PIL            S U P R E M E   C O U R T   O F   I N D I A                         RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS                    WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO(s). 494 OF 2012JUSTICE K.S.PUTTASWAMY(RETD)& ANR                 Petitioner(s)                 VERSUSUNION OF INDIA & ORS.
