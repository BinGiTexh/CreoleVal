Galupe ar Lulu, music in 3 scenes
09.07.2013
Last year, LALIT member Rajni Lallah composed the music for a short 6-minute film made by Mauritian university student Olivier Marie for his finals in film making studies in Malyasia. The film "script" and "story-line" is danced out by a professional Malaysian dancer with music intertwined in her dancing, like a duet. The music was created "in time" with and paced on the rhythm of her dance movements, but can be listened to for its own sake too. The title, in 3 musical "scenes" is called "Galupe ar Lulu" ("Running with the wolves", evoking the book "Women who Run with the Wolves" by Clarissa Pinkola-Estes). You can listen to the music by clicking into the music section of "Downloads" (see top left hand column) of our website.
