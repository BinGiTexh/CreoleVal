09.08.2004
Ram Seegobin, a LALIT leading member, is to address a meeting of civil servants organized by the Federation of Civil Service and Other Unions on Wednesday, 11th August, 2004 at the Sunni Soorthee Hall, in Corderie Street at midday.The theme for the meeting is the new "Mauritius Revenue Authority Bill", which the Government intends to pass, in order to centralize and privatize its revenue collection. The trade unions are all opposed to this legislation, in the first place because it involves existing civil servants from five departments being made literally to apply for jobs in the new "authority". As well as LALIT, the other main political parties are also invited to speak: the MMM, MSM, PMXD, Labour.
