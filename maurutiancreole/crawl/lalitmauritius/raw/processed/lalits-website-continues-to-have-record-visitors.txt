LALIT's website continues to have record visitors
12.07.2009
We are pleased to inform you that LALIT's website continues to have more and more visitors each month.So far in 2009, we have already had 163,615. This is 25,000 more than the whole of 2008, which was already a record year (not counting freakishly high hits one previous year.) This increasingly high rate of visits is despite three serious incidents of hacking, from which our site is only now recovering.
