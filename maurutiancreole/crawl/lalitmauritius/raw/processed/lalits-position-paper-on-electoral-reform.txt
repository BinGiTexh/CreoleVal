LALIT's Position Paper on Electoral Reform
05.08.2010
A new LALIT Commission on Electoral Reform has met on six Saturdays over a 12-week period in 2010, in order to come up with proposals on how to further democratise the electoral system and how, at the same time, to eliminate the communalism in the First Schedule of the Constitution which sets up the Best Loser System. This Paper has already been sent to the Prime Minister on Monday 2nd August, and appeared in Le Mauricien of 2nd August. It is available for download in the Document section of our website.
