New Women's Liberation Manifesto to be launched soon
28.09.2010
The Muvman Liberasyon Fam (Women's Liberation Movement) is now discussing the first draft of its new "Women's Manifesto". This follows a series of meetings that the association has organized with women from different currents within the women's movement every month over the past year. Some LALIT women members are in the Muvman Liberasyon Fam.The feature of the new Manifesto is that it starts with the original one of 1977, shows how the down-turn in the struggle for change over the past two or three decades since around 1982 has allowed the "status quo" and right wing political parties and the media to give their own invented definition of what the women's movement's demands are. Now with the series of crises in the capitalist system, the women's movement is preparing to fight back, and the new Manifesto is one of the tools the women's movement intends to use.
