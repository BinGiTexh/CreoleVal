DPP replies to LALIT's letter on new biometric ID card
27.06.2014
Let me thank Lalit for its letter, the contents of which have been noted.It is a fact that until there is a final pronouncement on the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the Act, it would be unlikely for me as DPP to exercise my powers  under Section 72 of the Constitution of Mauritius  to initiate criminal proceedings against those  persons who have failed without reasonable excuse to apply for the new identity card but at the same time it would constitute a gross dereliction of my duty as Director and an abuse of my powers were I  to undertake  that a crime yet to be committed would not lead to prosecution.I would certainly make my position known on or after the 15 September as there is a legitimate public interest consideration in the matter.Satyajit Boolell SCDPP
