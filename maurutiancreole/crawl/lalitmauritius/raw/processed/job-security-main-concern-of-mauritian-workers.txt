19.07.2003
Here is an extract of the Mauritian Social Attitudes Survey 2002 on Work & Employment carried by the University of Mauritius. "For 63% of all respondents, job security is clearly the most important aspect of work.""Good pay is the most important aspect of work for just over 20% of respondents, while working in a safe environment is considered to be the most important aspect of work for 11%""In general it can be seen that Mauritian workers are mainly concerned with their job security and less so with with their packets."Source: Centre for Applied Social Research, University of Mauritius
