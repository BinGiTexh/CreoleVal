The Chagos Refugees Group, which was present on 20th March, is part of the Peace Flotilla Initiative.Other organizations are invited to adhere to the Common Declaration. It is this conscious mass support that will be the basis for the success of the return to Diego Garcia.International Support already gained:Over 100 organizations world-wide have shown support, to Lalit, for the initiative of a ship or flotilla to take the Chagossians back to Diego Garcia. They range from huge organizations like the CND (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) in the UK, to big anti-base organizations in Okinawa, Japan and in South Korea, from War Veterans Organizations in the USA to womens groups in the USA, from organizations in Philippines and Puerto Rico that led successful campaigns to close down the bases like Subico Bay and Clark in the Philippines and Vieques only last year on 1st May in Puerto Rico, from Peace committees within the Quaker religion, to anti-war movements in South Africa and Holland. During the World Social Forum in Mumbai, and during the Intercontinental Youth Camp held as part of the WSF, in January, 2004, both Lalit members and the Chagos Refugees Group members gave speeches, which put the issue of Diego Garcia firmly on the agenda. Peace Flotilla to Diego GarciaOn the occasion of 20th March worldwide protests against war and against occupation, we, as representatives of organizations, met so as to discuss, amend and adopt the following important statement:RE-UNIFICATIONOn 12th March, 2004 we celebrated Independence and Republic Day, reminding us of the urgent necessity of returning and re-uniting all the islands of Mauritius, including the islands of the Chagos Archipelago, namely Peros Banos, Salomon, Diego Garcia, to the Republic of Mauritius. The Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia, was illegally excised by the UK, the former colonial power, and Diego Garcia was unlawfully handed over to the US that has since occupied it and used it as a military base to wage war against Iraq and other nations.NO MORE BOMBS FROM MAURITIAN LANDWe wish, by our signature below, to make it abundantly clear to everyone in the world that we object strongly to a part of Mauritian land continuing to be used as a launch pad from which to drop bombs on living people, their societies and civilizations, all living things they know and the natural world they live in, leaving desolation where there was life.NO TO WAR, NO TO OCCUPATIONAs part of the worldwide protest against war and against occupation particularly of Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan, we call for an end to the USA-UK occupation of Diego Garcia.CLOSE THE BASE ON DIEGO GARCIAWe call for closure of the US-UK military base on Diego Garcia.ECOLOGICAL CLEAN-UPWe call for the clean-up of Diego Garcia and the Chagos Islands, after all the ecological damage that the USA and UK have inflicted on these pristine coral islands, being particularly careful to remove all the dangers associated with stocking of nuclear weapons.NO U.S. BASES, NO WAR BASESWe call for the closure of all US military bases world-wide, and for the closure of all other imperial military bases. We oppose the opening of new military bases.A SHIP TO TAKE CHAGOSSIANS TO DIEGO GARCIAWe support the initiative to get a ship to take Chagossians back to Diego Garcia and the Chagos. This would embody their right to return, bearing in mind that they have never given up their struggle to recover their homeland. And we support their claim for full reparations for the harm and suffering they have endured as a result of their forcible removal.SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE FLOTILLAWe support this ship initiative as it becomes transformed into the plan for a whole Peace Flotilla to go to Diego Garcia, as its first port of call. We demand the re-unification of the Chagos Archipelago to the Republic of Mauritius. We want peace in the Indian Ocean, peace in the whole world. We call on all workers organizations, social movements, womens, youth and neighbourhood organizations and all peace loving people to join in and to support the peace flotilla.
