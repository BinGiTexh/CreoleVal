Message of Support from Okinawa,Japan
09.11.2010
Diego Garcia is Okinawa in the Indian Ocean, and Okinawa is Diego Garcia in the Western Pacific. Both of them are islands where humans who have absolute dignity live. We must turn over the history that has been ruined by superpower's greed. They are still children. As mature human beings, we need to scold and rehabilitate them. We hope the conference may succeed.Okinawa Awase Bible Church
