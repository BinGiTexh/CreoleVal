New Mobilization against 1838 Anti-Abortion Law
23.04.2009
The Common Front on Abortion on Tuesday submitted a petition signed by its founder-members to the Prime Minister for the immediate suspension of the 1838 anti-abortion law. This is a new demand in response to the 33 year delay in a new law. LALIT has since then signed up to the petition for suspension of the law.The question of the continued illegality of abortion has become pressing, especially after the tragic death of Marie-Noelle Derby, photographer-journalist 31 years of age, and in the context of the criminal charges against 25-year-old Shabeela Kalla, who will be in the Intermediate Court on 7 May after undergoing an abortion under duress. Below is the content (in translation from the Kreol):Given the deaths of many women after illegal abortion, and with the aim of preventing further deaths,We put the following interim demand to you as Prime Minister: that the Government/National Assembly, as debate on a new law continues, in the meantime, suspends the 1838 anti-abortion law.Prior to this, it will be necessary to amend the law that governs illegal practice of medicine so as to ensure that backstreet abortions are deemed to be "illegal practice of medicine".Signatory OrganisationsVidya B.Charan, Mauritius Family Planning and Welfare Association (M.F.P.W.A)Rita Ramdin, Mauritius Alliance of Women (M.A.W)Rajni Lallah , Muvman Liberasyon Fam (M.L.F) Marie-Noelle Elissac-Foy, Women In Networking (W.I.N)Liliane Julien, Federation of Parastatal Bodies and Other Unions (F.P.B.O.U)Christine Rochecouste-Collet , Soroptimist Club de Port-Louis Soomantee Brigemohane, Women's International AssociationSignatory IndividualsLeela Devi Dookun-Lutchoomun, Individual (Ed: She is an MP)Touria Prayag, IndividualVel Moonien, JournalistDeepa Bhookhun, JournalistMichaela Seblin, Individual/JournalistDaniella Bastien, IndividualNathalie Rose, IndividualThis joint letter was delivered in person to the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday 14 April, 2009 at 12.15 hrs.
