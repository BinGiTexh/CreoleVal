LALIT153 Main Road,GRNW, Port LouisRepublic of Mauritius.lalitmail@intnet.muwww.lalitmauritius.org5 April, 2010.The Chairman,Electoral Supervisory Commission,Max City Building,Cnr Remy Ollier & Louis Pasteur Strs,Port Louis.Dear Sir,I am writing to the Commission, on behalf of the LALIT Party, regarding what we consider to be an unacceptable interference by the President of the Republic in the electoral campaign which started once the National Assembly was dissolved on 31st March 2010.In a newspaper interview published on pages 8 and 9 of L'Express of 2nd April 2010, President Jugnauth makes a certain number of statements which clearly represent a gross interference in partisan politics.Since "free and fair" elections cannot be guaranteed when there is interference by institutions of the permanent "state", we are asking the Commission to act to ensure that the Presidency, the Civil Service and Parastatals, and the "caretaker government" do not attempt to exert undue influence on the electorate. Yours truly,Ram D. Seegobin, for LALIT  Copy to the Press
