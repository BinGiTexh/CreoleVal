REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS TO ALL LALIT MILITANTS, CHAGOSSIANS AND ACTIVISTS PARTICIPATING IN THIS HISTORIC CONFERENCE. YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA, THROUGH THE APF, ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE ONGOING STRUGGLE FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE IMPERIALIST DIEGO GARCIA MILITARY BASE, AN END TO THE ILLEGAL  OCCUPATION OF THE CHAGOS ISLANDS AND THE RIGHT TO RETURN AND FULL REPARATIONS FOR ALL CHAGOSSIANS. IN SOUTH AFRICA WE ARE ALL TOO AWARE OF THE COMBINED HUMAN AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY BOTH PAST AND ONGOING FORMS OF COLONIALISM AND IMPERIALISM. TO WIN THE BATTLE AGAINST THESE TWIN FOES OF HUMANITY AND PROGRESS, WE MUST CONTINUE TO LINK OUR STRUGGLES AND CREATE COLLECTIVE SOLIDARITIES - PRECISELY WHAT THIS CONFERENCE IS ALL ABOUT. NONE OF US CAN BE TRULY FREE UNTIL WE ARE ALL FREE! JUST AS IT WAS WITH APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA, JUST AS IT IS WITH THE PRESENT PALESTINIAN STRUGGLE, SO TOO IS IT WITH THE CONTINUED AND ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF THE CHAGOS ISLANDS. NOW MORE THAN EVER, WE NEED TO RELENTLESSLY CONFRONT, EXPOSE AND REJECT THE PROFIT-DRIVEN, MILITARISTIC AND ANTI-PEOPLE SYSTEM THAT AFFLICTS OUR WORLD, WHEREVER WE ARE. WE ARE WITH YOU TOGETHER!!ãDale Mckinley
