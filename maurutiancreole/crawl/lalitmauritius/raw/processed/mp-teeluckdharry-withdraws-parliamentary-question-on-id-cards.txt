M.P. Teeluckdharry withdraws Parliamentary Question on ID Cards
11.09.2015
The Government back-bencher Member of the National Assembly, Mr. K. Teeluckdharry, who was also the barrister representing Dr. Madhewoo in his Supreme Court case against the biometric ID Cards, asked a pertinent Question of the Minister concerned, but has, it would seem, subsequently withdrawn the question. The question and its withdrawal is reported in Hansard No. 29 of 2015, for the 8 September sitting. Here is what Hansard says, word-for-word starting on page 79, until the word âWithdrawnâ at the end.Â âBIOMETRIC IDENTITY CARDS PROJECT - DATABASEâ(No. B/452) Mr K. Teeluckdharry (Second Member for Pamplemousses & Triolet) asked the Minister of Financial Services, Good Governance and Institutional Reforms, Minister of Technology, Communication and Innovation whether, in regard to the Biometric Identity Cards Project, he will state ââ(a) the cost incurred for the implementation, setting up and maintenance of databases therefor, andâ(b) if Government proposes to do away with the ââ(i) practice of compulsorily requiring Mauritian citizens to give their fingerprints and other biometric data for the purpose of obtaining a national identity card, andâ(ii) features contained in the biometric card, namely, the contactless integrated micro-chip and the integrated Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID).â(Withdrawn)âÂ The question that LALIT is posing is whether this question was withdrawn for political reasons, i.e. the Government does not want to reply to it. We do not know.
