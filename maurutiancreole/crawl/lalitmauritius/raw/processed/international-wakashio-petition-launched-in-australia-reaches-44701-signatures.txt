International Wakashio Petition launched in Australia reaches 44,701 signatures
04.09.2020
The Wakashio oil-spill petition launched by the Australian group around the publication âRed Antâ as soon as the spill was known, and addressed to the Government of Japan and Mitsui Company has reached 44,701 signatures by the morning of Friday 4 September. This is an example of internationalism in action.Â In particular, the petition organizers have reached out to Australian and international maritime unions and to the International Transport Workersâ Federation, calling for the Japanese Government and the Japanese company that owns the ship to take their responsibility for reparations.Â The socialists in the group âRed Antâ describe their current as standing for âanti-imperialist Marxismâ. LALIT has been in close contact with them from 2005 when Ram Seegobin was a speaker at the Asia-Pacific Solidarity Conference in Sydney that they hosted. Since then, four other members of LALIT have attended conferences organized by this political current. One of the leading members, the late John Percy was guest speaker at LALITâs International Action Conference on Diego Garcia in 2010.Â Here is the wording of the petition.

The Government of Japan and Mitsui must fund the oil spill response in Mauritius
The oil spill now taking place off the Mauritian coast may become the biggest ever environmental disaster to affect the country.
The Japanese owned bulk carrier MV Wakashio struck a reef off the coast of Mauritius on July 25. Since then more than 1,000 tons of diesel and bunker fuel have leaked into the ocean while a further 3,000 tons still remains onboard at risk of leaking.

The growing oil slick threatens local communities reliant on fishing, tourism and related industries for their survival.
A speedy emergency response can reduce the extent of damage. Action must be taken now.
The MV Wakashio is flagged in Panama but owned by the Japanese company Nagashiki Shipping.
