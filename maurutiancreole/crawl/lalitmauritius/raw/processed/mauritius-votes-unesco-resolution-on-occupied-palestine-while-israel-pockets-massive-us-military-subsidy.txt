Mauritius votes UNESCO Resolution on Occupied Palestine while Israel pockets massive US military subsidy
16.10.2016
As Mauritius confronts the USA-UK alliance in the United Nations over their continued occupation of Chagos, Mauritius is also amongst 24 countries in the executive Committee of UNESCO that voted bravely in favour of the Draft Resolution on âOccupied Palestineâ on 13 October 2016, that is three days ago.Â The resolution calls on Israel, inter alia, to stop its continued excavation of East Jerusalem and its flaunting of previous Resolutions on Jerusalem and to reconstruct what it has destroyed in Gaza.Â It is important that, just as people in Mauritius have put pressure and continue to put pressure on the Government to stand up for Palestinians living under military occupation and even under siege in Gaza, that all peoples world-wide do the same relative to their own Governments. This is particularly important as the final vote will be coming this next week. This kind of pressure, alongside an accentuation of the international campaign started by Palestinians for Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions (BDS) is helping to change the balance of political and economic forces against the domineering regime in Israel.Â We appeal to all our readers to follow the reality of the Palestinian struggle by going beyond the part-lying, part-masking reporting that typifies mainstream television coverage on Israelâs occupation of Palestine. Once you have understood the main problem of continued cruel colonization by the Israeli state of Palestine, all the propaganda in the world cannot cover up or deny the reality of what is going on. But, for initial understanding, it is important to put an effort into going beyond what is in the mainstream media, where Israel is portrayed as the âvictimâ when it is the aggressor.Â Coming back to the UNESCO Resolution on Occupied Palestine, only 6 countries, including the USA and UK voted against the motion, while 24, including Mauritius, voted in favour. Note that the power of the dominating powers is to get as many as 26 countries to abstain, plus two to be absent. The full text of the very carefully worded Resolution is reproduced below for LALITâs readers, as well as the way in which different states members of the executive Committee of UNESCO voted.Â Background of USA massive military support for Israeli colonizationOn 13 September 2016, just one month before the UNESCO draft resolution, the USA made an agreement with Israel for the biggest subsidy ever given to another country: $38 billion in military aid over the next 10 years. This was disclosed by Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper.Â This massive US military-financial support, agreed upon in the middle of the US electoral campaign, is clearly what gives the Israeli state apparatus the impunity it benefits from that enables it to pursue its hideous, anachronistic colonization of Palestine, coupled with Apartheid policies against Palestinians. This aid comes at a time when the people of the United States are beginning to succeed in getting themselves informed about the role of their Government and their own tax-money in what can only be described as a genocide of the Palestinian people, and helping, through BDS (Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions) to put a stop to it.Â Success of BDS gives rise to attempts to Ban BDS The BDS (Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions) worldwide movement against Israeli vested interests is gaining so much strength now that the Israeli Government has had to legislate against it. This was as early as 2011. So successful has the BDS campaign been that, in fact, over 12 States in the USA have rushed to pass laws, under pressure from Israeli interests, specifically outlawing BDS. BDS works both economically and ideologically, and this means that Israel gets exposed to public view and thus deprived of the international protection that ensures it Â Â a veil of impunity.The anti-BDS laws are an extreme infringement on democratic freedom in the USâs already shrinking post-PATRIOT democratic space.In February this year the UK, another staunch ally of the Israeli state, without going through Parliament announced a new law to ban publicly funded institutions from boycotting Israeli goods and services on political grounds. This ban includes student unions, universities, local councils and the National Health Service. The British Cabinet put out a communiquÃ© arguing rather weakly that âLocally imposed boycotts can roll back integrationâ and âfuel anti-Semitismâ, thus conflating opposition to a boycott against a rogue sovereign state with anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism, in LALITâs view, must be opposed as part of an ongoing anti-racist and anti-bigotry movement that insists, without compromise, on equality for all.In June this year, the England and Wales High Court, however, dismissed a judicial review case brought by the new NGO âJewish Human Rights Watchâ against three local authority Councils: Leicester City, Gwynedd, and Swansea.Â The judgment (http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1512.html), though a set-back for those trying to get BDS outlawed, and while a victory for the freedom of political expression, is not an outright victory for BDS.Â The case followed attempts to give carefully worded Municipal Council support to BDS. In 2014, the Leicester City Council resolved âinsofar as legal considerations allow, to boycott any produce originating from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank until such time as [Israel] complies with international law and withdraws from Palestinian Occupied territoriesâ. Gwyneth Council the same year âcall[ed] for a trade embargo with Israel and condemn[ed] the over-reaction and savageness used [in Gaza]. ... [The Council] confirm[ed] ... [its] decision [not to invest] in Israel or in that countryâs establishmentsâ. Previously, in 2010, Swansea Council noted âwith regret that Veolia is involved in ... contracts with the City & County of Swanseaâ and called on âthe Leader & Chief executive to support the position of the UN in regards to the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalemâ and to note âthat Council does not wish to do business with any company in breach of international law ...â. There was a proviso that the boycott not contravene any law.Â The Court found that non-binding resolutions by publicly funded bodies are not unlawful. This represents an important victory for free expression.Â Â Â  FULL TEXT of the UNESCO Draft RESOLUTION of 13 October 2016Â PARIS, 12 October 2016executive Board of UNESCOTwo hundredth sessionPROGRAMME AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS COMMISSION (PX)Item 25: OCCUPIED PALESTINEÂ DRAFT DECISION Submitted by: Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and SudanÂ I.A Jerusalem The executive Board,1.

The resolution is scheduled to be approved next week by UNESCOâs executive Board.[It seems that the Director General has requested a delay for the final approval]Â Voting in favor were: Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chad, China, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Mauritius, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan and Vietnam.Â Voting against were: Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, The Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States.Â Abstaining were: Albania, Argentina, Cameroon, El Salvador, France, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, Haiti, India, Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan, Kenya, Nepal, Paraguay, Saint Vincent and Nevis, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda and Ukraine.Â Â Absent were: Serbia and Turkmenistan.Â Original: EnglishÂ 
As Mauritius confronts the USA-UK alliance in the United Nations over their continued occupation of Chagos, Mauritius is also amongst 24 countries in the executive Committee of UNESCO that voted bravely in favour of the Draft Resolution on âOccupied Palestineâ on 13 October 2016, that is three days ago.
Â The resolution calls on Israel, inter alia, to stop its continued excavation of East Jerusalem and its flaunting of previous Resolutions on Jerusalem and to reconstruct what it has destroyed in Gaza.
Â It is important that, just as people in Mauritius have put pressure and continue to put pressure on the Government to stand up for Palestinians living under military occupation and even under siege in Gaza, that all peoples world-wide do the same relative to their own Governments. This is particularly important as the final vote will be coming this next week. This kind of pressure, alongside an accentuation of the international campaign started by Palestinians for Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions (BDS) is helping to change the balance of political and economic forces against the domineering regime in Israel.
Â We appeal to all our readers to follow the reality of the Palestinian struggle by going beyond the part-lying, part-masking reporting that typifies mainstream television coverage on Israelâs occupation of Palestine. Once you have understood the main problem of continued cruel colonization by the Israeli state of Palestine, all the propaganda in the world cannot cover up or deny the reality of what is going on. But, for initial understanding, it is important to put an effort into going beyond what is in the mainstream media, where Israel is portrayed as the âvictimâ when it is the aggressor.
Â Coming back to the UNESCO Resolution on Occupied Palestine, only 6 countries, including the USA and UK voted against the motion, while 24, including Mauritius, voted in favour. Note that the power of the dominating powers is to get as many as 26 countries to abstain, plus two to be absent. The full text of the very carefully worded Resolution is reproduced below for LALITâs readers, as well as the way in which different states members of the executive Committee of UNESCO voted.
Â Background of USA massive military support for Israeli colonization
On 13 September 2016, just one month before the UNESCO draft resolution, the USA made an agreement with Israel for the biggest subsidy ever given to another country: $38 billion in military aid over the next 10 years. This was disclosed by Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper.
Â This massive US military-financial support, agreed upon in the middle of the US electoral campaign, is clearly what gives the Israeli state apparatus the impunity it benefits from that enables it to pursue its hideous, anachronistic colonization of Palestine, coupled with Apartheid policies against Palestinians. This aid comes at a time when the people of the United States are beginning to succeed in getting themselves informed about the role of their Government and their own tax-money in what can only be described as a genocide of the Palestinian people, and helping, through BDS (Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions) to put a stop to it.
Â Success of BDS gives rise to attempts to Ban BDS 
The BDS (Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions) worldwide movement against Israeli vested interests is gaining so much strength now that the Israeli Government has had to legislate against it. This was as early as 2011. So successful has the BDS campaign been that, in fact, over 12 States in the USA have rushed to pass laws, under pressure from Israeli interests, specifically outlawing BDS. BDS works both economically and ideologically, and this means that Israel gets exposed to public view and thus deprived of the international protection that ensures it Â Â a veil of impunity.
The anti-BDS laws are an extreme infringement on democratic freedom in the USâs already shrinking post-PATRIOT democratic space.
In February this year the UK, another staunch ally of the Israeli state, without going through Parliament announced a new law to ban publicly funded institutions from boycotting Israeli goods and services on political grounds. This ban includes student unions, universities, local councils and the National Health Service. The British Cabinet put out a communiquÃ© arguing rather weakly that âLocally imposed boycotts can roll back integrationâ and âfuel anti-Semitismâ, thus conflating opposition to a boycott against a rogue sovereign state with anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism, in LALITâs view, must be opposed as part of an ongoing anti-racist and anti-bigotry movement that insists, without compromise, on equality for all.
In June this year, the England and Wales High Court, however, dismissed a judicial review case brought by the new NGO âJewish Human Rights Watchâ against three local authority Councils: Leicester City, Gwynedd, and Swansea.
Â The judgment (http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/1512.html), though a set-back for those trying to get BDS outlawed, and while a victory for the freedom of political expression, is not an outright victory for BDS.
Â The case followed attempts to give carefully worded Municipal Council support to BDS. In 2014, the Leicester City Council resolved âinsofar as legal considerations allow, to boycott any produce originating from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank until such time as [Israel] complies with international law and withdraws from Palestinian Occupied territoriesâ. Gwyneth Council the same year âcall[ed] for a trade embargo with Israel and condemn[ed] the over-reaction and savageness used [in Gaza]. ... [The Council] confirm[ed] ... [its] decision [not to invest] in Israel or in that countryâs establishmentsâ. Previously, in 2010, Swansea Council noted âwith regret that Veolia is involved in ... contracts with the City & County of Swanseaâ and called on âthe Leader & Chief executive to support the position of the UN in regards to the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalemâ and to note âthat Council does not wish to do business with any company in breach of international law ...â. There was a proviso that the boycott not contravene any law.
Â The Court found that non-binding resolutions by publicly funded bodies are not unlawful. This represents an important victory for free expression.
