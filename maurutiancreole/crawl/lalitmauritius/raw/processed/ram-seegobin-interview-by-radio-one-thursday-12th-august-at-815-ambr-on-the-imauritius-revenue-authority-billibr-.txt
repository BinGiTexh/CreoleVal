Thursday, 12th August, Ram Seegobin, Lalit member, will be interviewed by Radio One at 8.15 a.m. The interview is on the Mauritius Revenue Authority Bill. The proposed legislation is threatening to centralise the five Tax Revenue departments into a new "authority" which will be run as a private company. The trade unions are all opposed to this legislation, in the first place because it involves existing civil servants from five departments being made literally to apply for jobs in the new "authority".
