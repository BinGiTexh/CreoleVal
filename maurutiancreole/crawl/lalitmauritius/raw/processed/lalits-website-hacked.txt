LALIT`s Website hacked
26.01.2009
LALIT informs readers of our website that our site was hacked between the night of Sunday 25 January  and Monday morning (Mauritian time). The home page was defaced, and certain articles and documents (many in support of Palestine) were destroyed. The hacker signed "Serseridelikan". LALIT is in the process of updating and adding the missing material so that despite this hacking incident, we can continue on events, issues, actions in the socialist struggle here in Mauritius.
