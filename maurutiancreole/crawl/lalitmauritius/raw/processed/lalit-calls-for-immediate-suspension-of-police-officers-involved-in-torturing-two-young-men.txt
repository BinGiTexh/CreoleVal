LALIT calls for immediate suspension of police officers involved in torturing two young men

LALIT calls for immediate suspension of the band of police officers who tortured two young men, inhabitants of Cite Vallijee and assaulted members of their family. The suspension of this band of police officers is vital when there is an ongoing police enquiry to stop any police tampering evidence as well to stop such police officers being in a position of power. Such human rights abuse is the result of a repression-based strategy to COVID 19 instead of a strategy based on rational argument and popular solidarity.
