Newsweek exposes Joint US-India Military Exercises on Diego Garcia
18.04.2019
At long last, since the ICJ case, it seems that the world media has managed to end its silence on Diego Garcia. Yesterday, 17 April, for example Newsweek published an article under the title âU.S. Conducts War Games Near Islands U.N. Demands It Give Back to Nativesâ (sic) by Tom OâConnor.Â Importantly, Â while exposing the military exercises on territory now known to be illegally occupied by the UK-USA, and while also exposing the fact that India participated in these exercises after decades of opposing the base, the article also refers to the International Court of Justice decision in February this year that Chagos, including Diego Garcia, is part of Mauritius, and must be decolonized speedily. At last, through struggle by people around LALIT, we forced the Mauritian Government to go to the African union for support, then to the UN General Assembly for a Resolution to go to the ICJ. The political content of the total legal victory is that people all over the world become more aware of this hidden bit of military force â outside all democratic control. Now, the Mauritian State must call for a date for base closure, instead of abjectly accepting the presence of a base over which the Mauritian people have no control, on Mauritian land.Â Source Link: https://www.newsweek.com/us-war-games-give-islands-back-1399771Â The article reads:âOn Monday, the U.S. held joint war games with India near a ring-shaped reef the United Nations says was illegally taken from its native residents.Â âDuring the activity, the U.S. and India navies deployed P-8 Poseidon aircraft, joined by the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Spruance, to conduct anti-submarine drills near the Chagos Archipelago that comprises 60 islands some 2,000 miles off Africa's eastern coast and 1,000 miles south of India in a stretch of the Indian Ocean still ruled by the United Kingdom.
