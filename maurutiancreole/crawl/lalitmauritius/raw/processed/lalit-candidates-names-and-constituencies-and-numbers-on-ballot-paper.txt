LALIT Candidatesâ Names and Constituencies, and numbers on ballot paper
04.12.2014
LALIT has pleasure in giving you the list of our candidatesâ numbers on the ballot papers (in all 20 Constituencies). And our âmo-dordâ: Vote all three LALIT candidates in the four constituencies where we have fielded three, and vote LALIT first in all the other Constituencies (then find two other candidates to make up the three you have to vote.) Some people like to vote by symbol. Where we have THREE candidates, thatâs easiest: it is a hammer crossed by a âlaserpâ, the hammer (on purpose) looking a bit like a giraffe, and the laserp like a bird. Port Louis - Constituency No. 1 (Roland Boussac, Lindsey Collen and Sarajane Naraina)Moka and Quartier Militaire - Constituency No. 8 (Roland Fozoo, Rada Kistnasamy, Alain Moorgen)   Rose-Belle and Vieux Grand Port - Constituency No. 11 (Sonia Dick, Pushpa Lallah, Guilliana Sabine)Beau Bassin and Petite Riviere - (Ricardo Durhone, Shabeela Kalla-Monasch, Ahmad Tallybally)Since the ballot papers can be very long, it is worth knowing the candidateâs NUMBER. (Remember, where LALIT has fielded only ONE candidate, you must look for two other candidates you trust, because you need to put three crosses in order for any to be counted!)PORT LOUIS - Constituency No 1.Vot 3 LALIT Nimero:  5,  6,  21PORT LOUIS - Constituency No 2.

Or visit our youtube channel for 25 short video clips on our program: go to www.youtube.com type âlalit mauritiusâ and youâll be there.Remember to vote early - remind others not to believe in rumours, nor to be intimidated. After voting LALIT, when the other parties all âkase-ranzeâ afterwards, and generally continue behaving as they have for some 30 years, it is always good to be able to say with pride, âI voted LALIT!âFor any other details, or to contact us, just phone 208 5551 or 208 2132.
