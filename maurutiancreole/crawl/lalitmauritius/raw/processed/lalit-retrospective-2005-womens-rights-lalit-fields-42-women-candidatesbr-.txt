LALIT retrospective 2005: WOMEN'S RIGHTS: Lalit fields 42% women candidates
01.01.2006
This year saw two important developments for women, through Lalit.  Firstly, Lalit is the first party ever to have fielded as many as 42% women amongst general election candidates. After a year of women's mobilization about participation in politics, Lalit was the only party to increase its percentage of women significantly.  Secondly, Lalit women, together with the Muvman Liberasyon Fam, have begun the long process of putting into question "gender" as a strategy, and of squarely re-centering the women's movement around the time-tested twin aims of "emancipation" and "liberation".
