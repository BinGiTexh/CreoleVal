Under What Law the executive Acted for the Curfew
06.04.2020
Mauritius went into âlockdownâ on 20 March. Then, as from 23 March, a curfew was added to the lockdown. Just so that we all know under what law the Government proceeded with the imposition of the strict curfew, we are publishing the full text of the Regulation below, a regulation made under the Public Health Act.Â The strict curfew was lifted, as you know, on 30 March, and we are back to just the âlockdownâ.Â Â Why we are publishing this is so that we monitor the executive, when it acts on its own.Â Â Already in Mauritius, the executive is too powerful relative to the Legislature, and with the health emergency, this tendency has increased. We must ensure that this does not become a new normal for after the health emergency recedes once the epidemic comes under control.Â Here is the text: Â Â General Notice No. 512 of 2020Â THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACTCurfew Order made by the Minister under regulation 14(1) of the Prevention and Mitigation of Infectious Disease (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020Â 1.
