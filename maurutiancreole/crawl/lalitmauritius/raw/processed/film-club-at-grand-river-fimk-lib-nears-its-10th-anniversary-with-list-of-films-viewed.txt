Film Club at Grand River, FimK-lib, nears its 10th Anniversary (with list of films viewed)
07.11.2015
 In February, the Film Club at Grand River called “FimK-lib”, its name being a play on “freedom” and “film club” in Kreol, will be celebrating its 10th anniversary. Meanwhile, we have pleasure in publishing the list of films viewed and discussed at the monthly projection. The film projected is chosen after the viewing and discussion of the preceding film - by those present. This means the selection is eclectic. Our guiding principles are to watch films that have affected the development of cinema, and to watch films from different currents of cinema. This means we learn to contrast this rich tradition with the rather threadbare tradition if you remain trapped within the style of Hollywood and Bollywood block-busters only, which is what is dished up on the commercial circuits. FimK-lib brings together people who love the cinema, and who want to view films – as opposed to just “watching” them to see what happens next – and then discuss them informally afterwards. Once members have been through this experience a few times, they become sensitive to how films are made, and to the way in which narratives, views, analyses, atmospheres are created in different ways: the way the camera moves, or doesn’t move; the way the music and other sounds are integrated; the particular lighting; the metaphors and symbols used and whether they work; the stand, if any, that the director is taking on an issue; the beauty of the filming; the power of the acting and the type of acting; the influence the film has had, or may, in future have. And so on.  The oldest film we have viewed was a Buster Keaton film The Navigator released in 1924. And we have watched 4 released in 2014, and will in December watch the 2015-release The Look of Silence, the documentary exposing the genocide in Indonesia that has been kept “silent” so long. The longest film we have viewed was the near 6-hour-long La Commune (Paris) by Peter Watkins (2000). Everyone has a different favourite. One or two turned out to be duds – but that was always interesting to know. We have viewed commedies like Peter Sellers in The Party and Jacques Tati films. And we have even viewed one or two exceptional “parts” of TV series: The Wire, and the BBC The Monocled Mutineer. Here is our list to date, including the coming film, The Look of Silence by Joshua Oppenheimer. 12 Years a Slave – Steeve McQueen (2013) – British24 City -
