Education Minister âAcculÃ©eâ by a Common Declaration
11.08.2021
The Education and Science Minister, Ms Leela Devi Dookun, has kept silent on the Mauritian Kreol language as medium. Two former Education Ministers, Messrs Kadress Pillay and Vasant Bunwaree, had begun to take a reasonable position by the end of their mandates, Lalit has observed. But nothing has changed since Colonial Times, in terms of the formal medium in schools. It is widely known that all teachers use Mauritian Kreol a lot âorallyâ in schools, thus getting around the thorny problem of children not understanding. With the lockdowns and schooling being done remotely, this suppleness of using the mother tongue that had developed to make the strict colonial rules slightly less draconian, has not been replicated. Even in these circumastances, the present Minister has made no move towards this eminently logical demand for the mother tongue, Mauritian Kreol to be used as medium for at the very least Maths and Science. Thus the initiative that Ledikasyon pu Travayer took on Monday 9 August, along with 19 well-known intellectuals with experience of different kinds in language and/or education to sign a âCommon Declarationâ.

Declaration on Mauritian Kreol as Written Medium for Science in Schools
Given the importance of our natural mother-tongues to the cognitive development of all human beings, especially as we grow up as children,
Given the harm done to all children by rote learning,
We, the undersigned, hereby add our voices to the call for the State to introduce theÂ teaching of mathematics and science in the mother tongue Mauritian Kreol,Â or alternatively, asÂ dual medium alongside English, including for textbooks and examinations.
