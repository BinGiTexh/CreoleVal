New LALIT Document exposes Old MMM Plot
09.09.2008
Readers who are interested in some of the more murky aspects of mainstream politics and journalism might like to look at the new article uploaded on to our DOCUMENTS Section yesterday. It is the complete low-down on the Paul Berenger 1987 plot against LALIT.LALIT decided to write up and publish this story, because we expect similar plots to be brewing again soon, and because so many of the people who had roles in the 1987 are still around. We hope the article and discussion it provokes might prevent this kind of calumny and corruption from ever happening with the same kind of impunity again.
