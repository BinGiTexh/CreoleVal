âRemembering Vidya Golamâs Lifeâ: A Report by Lindsey Collen
12.08.2015
I donât usually think much of supposed ânational characteristicsâ; they seem nothing more than some rule-of-thumb prejudice, disguised as something less obnoxious. But, when it comes to inventing a new kind of ceremony, something never held before, and holding it with panache, it is to the credit of many Mauritians that they/we do seem to be very good at it. Maybe itâs something in our history â of so recently as over the past 300 years having had to invent a whole society, again and again, when it was taken from us by slavery and indenture, generation after generation after generation.Anyway, Sunday afternoon, 9th August, at La Potiniere in Ebene, there was one such invented ceremony.It was held in memory of the late Vidya Golam. He was the passionate, life-long promoter of the mother tongues, Kreol and Bhojpuri, a fine writer, a legendary teacher and a sensitive, enthusiastic literary and film critic. As well as a bon vivan. And all this was, it would be accurate to say, celebrated â more than just commemorated â at this eclectic ceremony. The ceremony â completely secular, and deeply moving â was a homage, in itself, to a life, lived full to the brim of creativity.Â And dramaturge, Henri Favoryâs rendering of Vidyaâs finest poem, Voltiz Tu, was perhaps the most poignant moment because it somehow celebrated life, relative to all the clutter in it â clutter that can be hurled out joyously, thus the title. Vijay Naraidooâs reading of Petal Lapusyer, a little-known poem of Vidyaâs, in fact unpublished before the reading, one in a more mysterious mood, held a fine note, celebrating life, this time relative to death.To commemorate one year since Vidyaâs death from cancer, his widow Lolita, and two children, Luvinska and Vilans, together with Ledikasyon pu Travayer (an organization with which Vidya was associated for over 30 years), held this get-together of friends, work colleagues and family around a ceremony. The form of the event was a medley of short speeches, the reading of poems, singing of a song or two, a short power point, and rounding off with a drink to the memory of Vidya. (See the program below; it gives a good idea of the ceremony.)The MBC covered the event â as in life, in death, too, the written media was, by contrast, stingy in covering Vidya â and chose, I think, the best single introduction to Vidyaâs commitment: He was, as well as being a writer and teacher, one of the members of the âInternational Panel of expertsâ for the 2009 LPT International Hearing on the Harm Done by the Suppression of the Mother Tongue in Schools. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Here is the program, which was lightly modified on an impromptu basis:Â Program: Order of ceremony (3:00 to 4:00pm):1.

Anyway, Sunday afternoon, 9th August, at La Potiniere in Ebene, there was one such invented ceremony.
It was held in memory of the late Vidya Golam. He was the passionate, life-long promoter of the mother tongues, Kreol and Bhojpuri, a fine writer, a legendary teacher and a sensitive, enthusiastic literary and film critic. As well as a bon vivan. And all this was, it would be accurate to say, celebrated â more than just commemorated â at this eclectic ceremony.

Vijay Naraidooâs reading of Petal Lapusyer, a little-known poem of Vidyaâs, in fact unpublished before the reading, one in a more mysterious mood, held a fine note, celebrating life, this time relative to death.
To commemorate one year since Vidyaâs death from cancer, his widow Lolita, and two children, Luvinska and Vilans, together with Ledikasyon pu Travayer (an organization with which Vidya was associated for over 30 years), held this get-together of friends, work colleagues and family around a ceremony.

Â Here is the program, which was lightly modified on an impromptu basis:
