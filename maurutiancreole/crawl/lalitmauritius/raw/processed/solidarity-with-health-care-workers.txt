Solidarity with Health Care Workers
10.11.2021
As the Covid-19 epidemic worsens,Â and it could yet become critical,Â with the health system becoming overwhelmed,Â we, the undersigned,appeal to everyoneâs better judgment,especially during a pandemic,Â to avoid capitalizing, for any reason whatsoever,on the distress of the illor on the cries-of-pain of those mourning the loss of a dear one;Â to avoid heaping blame on hospital staff,Â or the health services, for the suffering brought by the epidemic;Â but instead be sure to act in ways that support health care workers,the very workers that, the moment we fall ill,are there to look after us and our families.We take this moment to put forward three demands that will help:1. That everyone eligible for vaccination step up and get vaccinated; this way we protect our health services,2. That everyone persist, during the crisis, wearing masks properly, keeping distance and avoiding crowds; this way we all slow down the spread of the virus;3. And that Government immediately recruit and train permanent staffas nurses, assistants and attendants to re-enforce the health care system, as well as public health.Â Â Name of organizationsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Atma Shanto,Â Federation des Travailleurs UnisHaniff Peerun,Â Mauritius Labour CongressÂ &Â All Workers ConfederationÂ Iqbal Amiran,Â Government Services Employees AssociationÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Ram Nowzadick,Â Nursesâ AssociationRajree Thylamay,Â union des Travailleurs de Ministere de la SantÃ©Â &Â All Workers Trade union FederationAnne-Marie Joly,Â Muvman Liberasyon FamVinod Seegum,Â Confederation of General Trade unionsMosadeq Sahebdin,Â Consumersâ Advocacy PlatformNorman Tambanivoul,Â Dr Idrice Goomany Treatment CentreReeaz Chuttoo,Â Confederation des Travailleurs de Secteur PrivÃ©Alain Ah Vee,Â LALITIndividual signatoriesCassam UteemAlain MuneeanImran DhanooÂ Â Â Carlo de SouzaGopalen ChellapermalÂ
