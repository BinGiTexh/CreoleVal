06.02.2008
LALIT member, Lindsey Collen, and Sylvio Michel OF/Les Verts will be on Habib Mosaheb's program Hard Talk on TOP FM at 5:30 today to discuss the question of reparations for slavery. LALIT readers probably know that LALIT has had a long campaign for reparations for the working class for the exploitation of the labour of its ancestor class of slaves and for damage to working class society. Lindsey Collen will be defending this position. In contrast the OF/Les Verts have run its campaign on an ethno-communal basis for individual compensation on the basis of being able to prove one is a blood descendant of slaves or for people to be compensated as an ethno-communal category.
