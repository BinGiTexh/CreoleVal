Three Day Youth Course held by Lalit
16.12.2003
LALIT  and Lalit's Youth Group, Grup Zenn Lalit, held a joint three-day Youth Course on 11th, 12th and 13th December at Lalit's headquarters in Grand River North West. The course was aimed at students on holiday. The people present, mainly girls, held discussions and debates on the themes of "democracy", "communalism", "language" and whether young people are in fact "not interested in politics". Those who were speakers or chairperson at the sessions included members of Lalit and of the Grup Zenn Lalit.This kind of informal education for young people is part of Lalit's tradition for the month of December. Each year, the kind of educational program is a bit different. We have in the past held residential "summer schools" and one-week "cadre training" schools.
