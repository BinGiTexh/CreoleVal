Alain Ah-Vee in Palestine protest: Letter to LALIT from former President of the Republic, Cassam Uteem
05.08.2004
In the context of the participation of Alain Ah-Vee, LALIT member, in the Palestine Freedom Walk, we have been receiving support messages from people in Mauritius and abroad. Here is a copy of the letter received by LALIT, addressed to Rajni Lallah, from the former President of the Republic, Mr. Cassam Uteem:âThank you very much for sending me a copy of the letter you addressed to the Trade Unions and Associations. âI am particularly pleased to place on record my deepest appreciation of the bold, principled and unique initiative LALIT has taken in delegating Mr. Alain Ah-Vee, one of its leading members, to participate in the international protest march, in Cis-Jordanie, against the illegal âapartheidâ Wall in the process of being built by Israel. This more-than-symbolic gesture is a reflection of your partyâs commitment and unflinching support to the cause of international justice. âThanks to this participation, fraught with difficulty and danger, Mauritius can feel legitimately proud to be in the forefront of the struggle of the Palestinians for their legitimate rights. âPlease accept, dear Rajni, the assurances of my warmest regards and convey to Alain my very best wishes and highest esteem. âYours sincerely, âCassam Uteem.â
