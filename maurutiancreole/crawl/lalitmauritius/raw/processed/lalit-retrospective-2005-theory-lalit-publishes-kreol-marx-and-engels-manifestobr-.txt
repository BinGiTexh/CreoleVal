LALIT retrospective 2005: THEORY: Lalit publishes Kreol Marx and Engels MANIFESTO
01.01.2006
This year saw the first ever book-form and first ever Audio-CD-form versions of the MANIFESTO by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. The translation is very much updated from the serialized version that Lalit brought out from 1978-79 in Lalit de Klas. The book and CD went hand in hand with a series of theoretical sessions on what "work" is, in Marxist terms, relative to capital held all over the country. Together with the "Economic Alternatives" campaign, the sessions give a thorough background. The new year 2006 begins with Lalit preparing the emergency mobilization against the economic crisis.
