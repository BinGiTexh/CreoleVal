Politics and Art
19.12.2004
In LALIT's first session on "politics and art" held at Grand River North West on Friday afternoon 17 December, a group looked at the relationship between political change and literature in the English language from the year 700 until the present.The session included a one-and-a-half hour session in Mauritian Kreol by Lalit member, Lindsey Collen, on "How to recognize from simple aspects of the style of writing and from the content what time period any given piece of literary work comes from". In one-and-a-half hours, you can get a good feeling for this literature "as a whole", she said. "Literature is not separate from political history," she said, "but is influenced by it, and sometimes, though rarely, can influence it, in return." The kinds of political and economic events that provoke new forms are the French revolution and the industrial revolution, to take examples.The group discussed the importance of literature today, when reading is a more generalized phenomenon than in the past, in developing the emotional maturity of human beings, by allowing readers to go through a wealth of emotional experiences.
