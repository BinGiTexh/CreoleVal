15.07.2003
According to an instructive survey conducted by the Centre for Applied Social Research of the University of Mauritius  "some 54% of the sample population had a total monthly personal income of less than Rs 4,000. 7% of the respondents enjoyed a personal income of greater than Rs 10,000 per months. Only 5% brought in Rs 12,000 or more."  The result of this survey is a blatant response to the "Mauritian miracle" propaganda conducted by neo-liberal ideologues.  This survey entitled Mauritian Social Attitudes Survey 2002 has for unknown reasons not yet made public. lalitmauritius.com will be publishing extracts of this survey in the coming days. So keep posted to Lalit's web site!
