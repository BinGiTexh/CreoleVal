Message from Hamamatsu Alliance for Human Rights and Peace
09.11.2010
We are a citizens' group in Hamamatsu, a city in central Japan. Our aim is to overcome colonialism and achieve peace in Asia with particular focus on the abolition of military bases. Today, we held a protest to call for the cancellation of a festival held by Japan Air Self-Defense Force's Hamamatsu Base where AWACS aircrafts and PAC3 missiles that Japan purchased from US defense corporations are deployed. World peace cannot be achieved without overcoming colonialism. Closing the military base in Diego Garcia, a springboard of war, is a crucial agenda for world peace. We wholeheartedly support Mauritians' struggle to end colonialism and close military bases.Hamamatsu Alliance for Human Rights and Peace
