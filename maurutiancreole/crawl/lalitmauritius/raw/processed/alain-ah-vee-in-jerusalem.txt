Alain Ah-Vee in Jerusalem
13.08.2004
Alain Ah-Vee, Lalit member who has been on the peaceful direct action march against the Apartheid Wall built by the Israeli State in Israel, has now completed his two weeks action. He has gone to Jerusalem, with two or three other participants, who are also wending their way home now. On the way to Jerusalem, they arrived at a Check Point only minutes after a suicide bomb had exploded, killing two Palestinians and badly injuring 6 Israeli soldiers. The check-point was closed. They had to take a long detour to another check-point. This gave an idea of the terrible toll of this terrible Wall.
