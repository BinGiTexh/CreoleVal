Women’s Declaration Against Sex Abuse
50 Mauritian women sign a 100-word Common Declaration Against Sex Abuse.
The Common Declaration Against Sex Abuse represents a shared stand against patriarchy. It comes after 50 years of Independence and in the build-up to International Women’s Day 2018, at the very time when all over the world there are uprisings of women against harassment by predatory men.
The Declaration has been co-ordinated by the Muvman Liberasyon Fam. MLF has included women – from different “currents of thinking” over the decades – who have made, and are making, a contribution to the women’s movement or to women’s emancipation through the contribution they make in their field.
Common Declaration
I, the undersigned, stand with women all over the world who are raising their voices against predatory men, men who use their positions of “relative power” on the worksite – or in other institutions – so as to abuse women. Times are changing. Organizations with a modicum of democracy – including political parties, unions and professional associations – are beginning, everywhere in the world, to hold men accountable, or to revoke them or expel them for abusing women. We, women, worldwide are beginning to raise our voices against sexual and sexist abuse. I for one will no longer collude with this.
Thus, I add my signature, me too.
