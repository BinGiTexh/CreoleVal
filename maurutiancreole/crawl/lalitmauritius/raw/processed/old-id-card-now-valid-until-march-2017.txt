Old ID card now valid until March 2017
28.03.2016
The Cabinet decided to extend the deadline for the replacement of the old ID cards until March 2017. Even this extension of the deadline is something of a victory against the new surveillance by the State through electronic means. First the central fingerprint data-base has been destroyed following years of protests by many organizations, and including dozens of LALIT actions which spearheaded the campaign.Â This new postponement â now until the Privy Council judgment â is just one more victory against the creeping repression through control of individuals by the bourgeois State.Â Â
