Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans viewed at Film Club
06.08.2012
Last week, the âFim kLibâ viewed the Murnau film made in 1927 called âSunrise: A Song of Two Humansâ, considered by cineaste Francois Truffaut to be âthe most beautiful film ever madeâ, âle plus beau film du mondeâ. The film was indeed beautiful. It is an allegory, at one level, with a woman in very high heels being âthe call of the cityâ, seducing a countryside peasant with her wolf-whistle to abandon the society and the culture (or even lack thereof) of the countryside. Yet, the film is complex, showing part of the âcall of the cityâ (in the sense of âthe call of the wildâ) is harmless, the city being something one can visit without, as it were, abandoning everything else. With masterpiece scenes of barbers, photographers, trams, a fancy fair,  and a storm attacking a tiny boat on a wild lake. Before the film started, in honour of silent movies, a member, Rada Kistnasamy, had downloaded the bit of Mr. Bean from Danny Boyleâs Opening Ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics, where Mr. Bean is seen playing in the London Symphony Orchestra, and dreaming of winning (by cheating, naturally for him) in a dream Olympics. In the Film Club, there was also discussion of Danny Boyleâs use of the working class âpageantâ form of art, for his ceremony, and using cinema as the basis for the show, not as an add-in. He also, a member said, gave âhistoryâ back to art. One of the destructive aspects of the last 30 years of neo-liberal ideology, has been the relegation of a feeling for history to the past. Obviously an understanding of the flow of  history is a pre-requisite for revolutionary change in modern society. So, if you can âbanâ it, you can help ensure the status quo reigns on. To get an idea of the films we have viewed and discussed in our Film Club, we, the collective that make up the Film Club, are pasting a list below. First is the name of the film, then the directorâs name, the year the film was made, and then somewhat vaguely, the lieu/language/tradition it is part of.
