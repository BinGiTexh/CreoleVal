Drop Charges against Occupiers of British Arms Factory Selling Drones to Israel!
14.08.2014
LALIT joins its voice to the voices of John Pilger, Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker, Ahdaf Soueif, Breyten Breytenbach, Miranda Pennell, Miriam Margolyes, Nick Cave, Richard Falk and Victoria Brittain who signed the following letter to The Guardian 12 August, 2014:âNine protesters last week occupied an arms factory based in Staffordshire and it was closed down for two days. The factory is owned by Elbit Systems, Israelâs biggest arms company (Report, 6 August). The drone components they make are allegedly used by the Israeli military to assault Palestinians in Gaza. This factory symbolises how strongly the UK is linked to Israelâs military. Over Â£190m of UK arms have been exported to Israel over the past five years. These nine protesters, who drew attention to UK complicity with Israeli violations of international law, are being charged with aggravated trespass for stopping this âlawfulâ factory operating. But selling these weapons to Israel is what is criminal here.âAll charges against the protesters should be dropped and a two-way military embargo should be imposed on Israel immediately.âLALIT calls for both demands: drop all charges and impose a two-way military embargo on Israel. We re-iterate our criticism of the USA for its massive military aid to Israel: it, together with Europe, literally finances the genocide of Palestinians by the Israeli State apparatus.
