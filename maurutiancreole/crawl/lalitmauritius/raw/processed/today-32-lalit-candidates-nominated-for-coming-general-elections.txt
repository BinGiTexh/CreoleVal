Today 32 LALIT candidates nominated for coming General Elections
30.05.2005
Today, 30 May, 2005 was Nomination Day, and Lalit has fielded 32 candidates as planned. Lalit has candidates in all constituencies, and all went well in all 20 constituencies.LALIT carried out an action against communalism or etho-religious classification a week before Nomination Day. A Schedule to the Constitution makes it obligatory that each candidate, in order for his or her Nomination Paper not to be rejected, has to fill in which of four Constitutionally defined socalled communities he or she belongs to. Lalit members refuse to do this kind of classification relative to the state. In 1983 and 1987 and again in the year 2000, we all drew from a hat what community to fill in. This time around we again performed this protest action.Lalit has been distributing leaflets on its program all over the country and has held three public meetings, one in Curepipe, one in Rosehill and one in Bambous.
