Happy New Year to all our visitors. For the New Year, we are introducing a new feature called âThe Writing is on the Wallâ, which starts 2012 with greetings for the New Year, and which will have slogans when they are appropriate, to alternate with photographs Our end of the year analysis of the political situation world-wide and in Mauritius by Ram Seegobin can be read in Kreol in an article entitled â2011 From LALITâs Political Perspectiveâ (See News Section), while LALITâs actions for 2011 summarized by Rajni Lallah can be read in the editorial of our magazine, Revi LALIT, (which should be in the documents section soon) and in the article entitled âReport on LALITâs Actions in 2011â (News Section).Hits on our site have now reached 1,000 per day, and the volume downloaded continues to increase. In all 1.7 million hits on www.lalitmauritius.org since our inception.We hope that 2012 will bring strength to struggles to end all military occupations, bombardments and invasions, thus making the way for peace, that will only come when there are no longer the â1%â who decide for us all.
