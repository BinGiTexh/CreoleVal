LALIT launches world-wide email petition to close down Diego Garcia
13.04.2005
LALIT on Saturday 12th March, which was INDEPENDENCE AND REPUBLIC DAY, announced the launch of a world-wide petition for the closing down of the US military base on Diego Garcia. This petition is to be sent to the elected representatives of the people in the countries concerned, i.e. the US, the UK and Mauritius. Then we will be organizing follow-up activist work, based on the signed petition. This petition was planned by LALIT after so many people wrote to us asking what they could do to help, during our campaign for a flotilla to go to Diego Garica, and after the excellent John Pilger film, STEALING A NATION. The petition was actually launched on 20 March to coincide with Lalitâs meeting against the war and against occupation.SUBJECT of PETITION:  CLOSE MILITARY BASE ON DIEGO GARCIA ISLANDTo:The Hon. J.
