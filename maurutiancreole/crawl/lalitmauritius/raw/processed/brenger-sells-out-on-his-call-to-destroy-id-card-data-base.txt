BÃ©renger Sells Out on his Call to Destroy ID CARD Data-Base
08.06.2014
LALIT notes that Opposition Leader Paul BÃ©renger has sacrificed his only recent political stand that is in any way truly democratic. He had announced just one week before his negotiations with Labour for a coalition began that he was in favour âof the destruction of the new biometric ID Cardâs centralized data-base.âHe quietly now announces the opposite. As soon as there is a Supreme Court judgement in the three big Constitutional cases against the new cards, he says, he will be the first to take out his ID card, no problem.  He is back to Alan Ganooâs abject position in the National Assembly when he was Leader of the Opposition in the absence of BÃ©renger, when he said he had âno quarrelâ with the new ID cards and all their biometric information.
